toshevon,Thu Oct 15 21:58:55 IST 2015,  still patiently waiting for your response to who is supposed to be regulating discos transformer related activities
toshevon,Wed Oct 07 19:02:50 IST 2015, i have been waiting for 3yrs please when are you deploying your services to phc smile don come and i dey tempted to switch o
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:43:26 IST 2015,  to discuss with the disco which one is it exactly should we or should we not buy transformers by ourselves
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:42:39 IST 2015,  recall in 2012 nerc asked yenagoans to stop transformer purchase  now we are being asked
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:38:53 IST 2015,  ok please refer me to the body in charge of regulating the discos activities with regards to issuance of transformers
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:37:37 IST 2015,  meaning you dont regulate the discos activities when it concerns services being rendered to consumers
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:32:48 IST 2015,  nercng will only wait till it becomes an arbitration issue before they step in thats a very good one one your part
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:31:19 IST 2015,  technically speakingnercng doest have a policy framework for such a situation its a matter of consumer-disco agreement
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:08:14 IST 2015, of the consumer since after purchase the transformer becomes the property of the disco how does the consumer enforce his rights
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 15:07:18 IST 2015, the question still remains whats the modality involved in such a situation is there any policy in place to protect the interest
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 13:33:48 IST 2015,  still same no light as they are still saying they dont have any transformer on ground expect we choose to pay for one
toshevon,Tue Oct 06 12:45:14 IST 2015, what baffles me is that the washing machine is still available for purchase  so why was it cancelled
toshevon,Mon Oct 05 23:02:54 IST 2015, i just check now and only the tv was dispatched and the washing machine was cancelled and to think no notification was sent

toshevon,Mon Oct 05 20:52:30 IST 2015, matter its been 2 weeks and there is no end in sight and this can continue for an extended period if nothing is done quickly
