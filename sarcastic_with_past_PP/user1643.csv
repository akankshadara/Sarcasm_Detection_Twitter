JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 23:48:35 IST 2016,the blackhawks have signed mac carruth and traded for drew macintyre the past few days clearly gearing up to trade corey crawford 
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 20:14:27 IST 2016,astonishing isnt the word id use probably one of the many synonyms for stupid  
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:47:17 IST 2016,ive been meaning to reread joe bidens autobiography talk about a great inspiration
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:45:58 IST 2016,this moment is ludicrously powerful justwow
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 09:43:17 IST 2016,mr vice president if you wont reconsider and run for president then please please host the oscars next year youd be amazing at it
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:40:51 IST 2016,solemn vow i will make it to an nwhl game next year preferably in boston knight is the absolute best but im not picky
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:22:43 IST 2016,not often that crawford makes a really bad play but that was one have to seal that post no excuse
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:12:23 IST 2016,what a play by richard panik in one motion wins a puck battle and fires a pass to rasmussen for the goal gorgeous stuff
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:07:04 IST 2016,well played shaw
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 01:05:51 IST 2016,curious how officials didnt tag toews with an elbowing penalty there wasnt intentional but still definitely worth a call
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:48:19 IST 2016, im not there get to go for a few weeks but the beats are killing me right now i love spring in arizona
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:44:27 IST 2016,   like when they had the rentals in last year and brought back desjardins
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:44:02 IST 2016,the downside of being a baseball writer long season with tons of travel upside spending a month and a half in florida or arizona
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:42:26 IST 2016,adamhess not at all the only time hes ever badly misused is when hes at left wing he stinks there
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:42:03 IST 2016, probably a good idea hes the best fit in terms of being replaceable and being able to demand a high draft pick or two
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:39:38 IST 2016, and also cant forget that panarin has bonuses kicking in that will up his contract along w/ seabs  anisimov extensions
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:39:19 IST 2016, hes way more likely to sign a cheaper deal when he hits restricted free agency than andrew shaw too good to keep him
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:37:59 IST 2016,adamhess that being said he could certainly have an impact at top line right wing if the spot was open but thats not his job this year
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:37:37 IST 2016,adamhess the problem certainly was that he cant create enough offense from a bottom six rw spot center gives him more freedom
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:32:10 IST 2016,we need to discuss this visor/sock/van combo joe maddon is everyones awesome uncle  
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:30:22 IST 2016, he was in colorado yesterday for the outdoor game
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:28:24 IST 2016,that angle of attack by teuvo really made that play holtby had to not only find him through traffic but couldnt cheat to the far post
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:19:46 IST 2016, i suppose its better than being the ben carson of twitter where you say terrible things and no one cares
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:18:53 IST 2016, youre a monster and you must be stopped
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:17:27 IST 2016,  i always have to click on it to make sure kind of like any bob mckenzie tweet
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:16:12 IST 2016,  well thats staal she wrote
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:08:04 IST 2016,its going to be very odd to see eric staal in another uniform
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:07:06 IST 2016,  jay is the brains of the operation and i just occasionally say smart things hes toews im shaw
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:05:11 IST 2016, it looks like he and teravainen may have something going look like they complement one another
JamesNeveau,Mon Feb 29 00:03:52 IST 2016, i think caps vs la chi or dal would be a blast
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:58:36 IST 2016,rule fun story watching the game with my mom and sister laughed and said yeah really helped them against the habs
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:57:46 IST 2016,19jtoews just completely vacated the zone there probably not a good plan when patrick kane is involved
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 23:56:12 IST 2016,just loved the awareness by van riemsdyk on the pass interception that led to kanes goal lightning quick decision to find kane and pass
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 21:49:55 IST 2016,id give an analogy for what this arsenal season has been like but it would be graphic and/or full of profanity
JamesNeveau,Sun Feb 28 11:36:45 IST 2016,i cant get over how comical it is that the warriors have clinched a playoff spot its only february
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 23:30:12 IST 2016, i simply cant imagine a world where its viewed as a good idea to let the postal service die its incredibly important
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 23:29:33 IST 2016, they want congress to act to keep the price the same the last increase was only scheduled to last two years
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:57:53 IST 2016,as an avid letter writer i have mixed feelings on this the price of stamps could go down for first time in 97 yrs 
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:50:02 IST 2016,jiri sekac has been claimed on waivers by the coyotes second time this year the hawks have lost a player to arizona on waivers tikhonov
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 22:45:24 IST 2016, according to cap friendly sekac puts them at 50 
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:52:47 IST 2016,  ladd seems to think so doubt its him but as we saw with desjardins anything is possible
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:44:21 IST 2016, i get the sense hes still got his ears open but hes in no rush q likes the defense as is although i still have s
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:09:02 IST 2016,phn i think if he wasnt part of the long-term plan they wouldnt have extended him definitely something to watch though
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:03:51 IST 2016, a decent prospect not great but solid for two rentals and a second round pick fair trade all around it would seem
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:03:15 IST 2016,pwhite  i think my expectation was top four still has time to develop though i need to be more patient
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 09:00:24 IST 2016,dangle with how well the hawks have done in attracting foreign and college guys theyll still be around to make you nervous 
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:58:01 IST 2016,this cannot be overstated great point by al should help ease the transition too  
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:57:25 IST 2016, pwhite id defer to sean on this but i feel like tvr hasnt developed the way i wanted him to this year
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:56:43 IST 2016, absolutely not sure if hell be here this year but hes coming and he looks really solid
JamesNeveau,Sat Feb 27 08:56:12 IST 2016, i think hes a really good player and one of the best draft picks bowman has made
