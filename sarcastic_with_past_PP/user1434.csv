charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:30:52 IST 2015,  so jesus is going to kill anyone who merely disbelieves he exists sounds appalling to me real immoral murderer
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:29:43 IST 2015,  where god commanded death for fornixation and adultery and even something as simple as kids saying they hate mom

charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:27:05 IST 2015,  in verses 3-5 jesus chastises them for making a way to avoid the law to put their offspring to death

charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:19:12 IST 2015,  of infants specifically of infants children and infants quite separately
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:18:43 IST 2015,  jesus is god or some part of god that means jesus bears some blame for 1 samuel 153 where he orders the murder
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:18:04 IST 2015,  what about where jesus says he and his father are one they are exact images of one another or maybe you believe
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:17:11 IST 2015,  do you think you know better than the apostle paul who taught that any who dont accept christ will not be saved
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 22:16:33 IST 2015,  i dont think i did actually did you know at matt 151-9 jesus chastised the jews for not killing their offspring
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 21:24:03 IST 2015,rt  catholics can live freely within a secularist society but secularists are not free in a catholic nation-paul bowler

charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 21:04:14 IST 2015,  a great education in america is that a joke
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:59:36 IST 2015,   neither does professor dawkins
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:59:19 IST 2015,   you apparently see a distinction btween skin colors that i do not because you think racially i do not
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:58:23 IST 2015,   youre the one making t about race islam is a religion not a race doesnt matter how many are dark
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 20:05:28 IST 2015,   no thats not how racism works lol ironically what you just said is racism all muslims are dark racist
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:36:48 IST 2015,rt  so true atheist secular atheism brights nones skeptic art jesus christian islam httpsâ€¦
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:34:37 IST 2015,  if you  insist it was racism and islam should he loved and adored instead of ridiculed move to syria keep in touch
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:33:21 IST 2015,  im pretty sure you started it by insisting islam was a race i replied to that by correcting your misunderstanding
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:27:22 IST 2015,  because even if he was hes not it wouldnt have any bearing on his ability to be right about that which he speaks
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:26:29 IST 2015,  even if this was true which it isnt it wouldnt nullify any of the things he has written or said
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:18:43 IST 2015,  again islam isnt a race its a religion
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:18:21 IST 2015,  islam is not a race so theres no way it can be racism lol
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:17:13 IST 2015, but you post an article about a real thing that happens and omg sorry ranting
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:16:48 IST 2015, nobody got all worked up when the kid got shot just for picking up a rocket launcher in american sniper
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:16:24 IST 2015, how many of them chant death to america right along with their parents
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:15:55 IST 2015, tbh im not sure why anyone finds it so absurd that a muslim kid is more likely to be a killer and likely not so innocent
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:13:59 IST 2015, i got your point the world is just still way to sensitive about religion thats the only reason this is happening
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:13:01 IST 2015,  by providing evidence islam makes kids killers facts
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:11:43 IST 2015,  and especially because hes muslim is this true if you disagree youre just ignoring reality a reality he showed
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:11:09 IST 2015,  his point is a well made one hes making the point that just because hes young doesnt mean hes innocent
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 19:06:10 IST 2015,  wow
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:56 IST 2015,  most hate in the world only exists because it came from some man claiming to speak for god
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:33 IST 2015,  and the hatred of gay people by both christians and muslims unnatural only because of religion
charliesbridge,Wed Nov 25 18:35:03 IST 2015,  do people naturally celebrate the death of their children like islamists do i think not
