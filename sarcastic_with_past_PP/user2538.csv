CopyDarryl,Thu Feb 25 05:15:33 IST 2016, why because he screwed up in the 4th year and drafted 7th 
CopyDarryl,Thu Feb 25 05:12:34 IST 2016, my only thought was no player but 97 should be untouchable if it improves the team the mix clearly is not good enough
CopyDarryl,Thu Feb 25 04:32:27 IST 2016,amazed many say we cant trade this guy or that guy dont care about c depth or core over 5 years of 30th only mcdavid  is untouchable

CopyDarryl,Tue Feb 23 20:09:35 IST 2016,rt  the time is now you give bautista the money considering how little the jays have cared up until last year they can pay…
CopyDarryl,Tue Feb 23 20:09:14 IST 2016,4enzix  that defeats the purpose of the draft its to help teams not market them shouldnt  change rules cause 1 teams inept
CopyDarryl,Tue Feb 23 19:48:33 IST 2016,4enzix  no kane and toews only helped in chicago until they became a contender then the us marketed them one example
