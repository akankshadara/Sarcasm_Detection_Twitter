SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:58:05 IST 2016,cant wait to see what all-bench lineup brown throws out there in the 2nd quarter  nets
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:53:30 IST 2016,i would say that the nets should know to make teletovic put the ball on the floor but theres only a few left whove played with him
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:47:17 IST 2016,nets just went about 5 offensive possessions without lopez even getting a touch
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:36:12 IST 2016,ok this njdevils game is over time to switch over to my other favorite train wreck--the brooklynnets
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 07:10:07 IST 2016,njdevils down 5-1 better effort in 2nd but not nearly enough to make up for the dumpster fire of a 1st period
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:54:41 IST 2016,njdevils get screwed why bother with replay
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:34:34 IST 2016,good to see the devils made it to the arena boucher cuts it to 3-1
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:31:54 IST 2016,new toward lines in addition to new goalie for njdevils to start 2nd period
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:14:49 IST 2016,4 njdevils josefson blandisi merrill  severson were minus-3 in 1st period something for hynes to think about in intermission
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:11:09 IST 2016,have to go to kincaid in 2nd period save schneider for tomorrow
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 06:10:10 IST 2016,cbj just quicker than the njdevils could easily be 5-0 instead of 2-0 at the rate nj produces goals it may as well be
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 05:51:16 IST 2016,we may see kincaid in net tonight after all not schneiders fault however blandisi just stared as the jackets put another one in
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 05:45:51 IST 2016,njdevils look lazy in columbus after big win over nyr josefson goof gives cbj early lead
SteveLichtenst1,Fri Feb 26 02:47:06 IST 2016,cant say im happy about sean marks move 2 this buyout is much different than d-will or bargs best wishes to joejesus
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:15:21 IST 2016, not arguing that  however priorities are  fit  teams chances at winning  then comes secondary considerations
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:11:50 IST 2016, i think that logic is overstating the impact  future free agents wont care about this when looking at offers
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:10:02 IST 2016,the nets are bad all over but they have very few 3s on roster especially with rhj out  who will take joes minutes
SteveLichtenst1,Thu Feb 25 23:08:29 IST 2016,if johnson was taking minutes from a young player who could have a future then sure a buyout makes sense for nets but thats not the case
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 20:40:29 IST 2016,njdevils win over rangers makes it easier for shero to justify standing pat at trade deadline  see new post at 
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 10:12:26 IST 2016,if only the nets lineup on the court was as good as their tv  radio lineup
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 10:11:17 IST 2016,dont get many chances to catch    but i feel treated after listening on my drive home from the  game
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:41:16 IST 2016,kalinin swears he knew about howe hat trick im from siberia but we get internet
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:10:09 IST 2016,empty netter makes it 5-2 unlike with the nets i dont appear to be a jinx for the njdevils theyre 2-0 at the rock with me there
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:07:03 IST 2016,im not sure kalinin knows who gordie howe is njdevils gordiehowehattrick
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 08:04:36 IST 2016,kalinin wraps up a nice night with a gorgeous move to beat lundqvist on a breakaway 4-2 devils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:46:05 IST 2016,now 7 minutes of pp time wasted by njdevils no idea what hynes thinks josefson brings to the first unit guy never moves off the half wall
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:42:16 IST 2016,i will admit that gionta would have probably fallen even if brassards stick wasnt near him
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:40:30 IST 2016,lundqvist denies tootoo as major pp ends njdevils  miss on big opportunity
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:37:36 IST 2016,rangers finally shutting down njdevils backdoor play on pp
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:36:39 IST 2016,not a very good first half of pp for njdevils rangers have had best chance
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:27:20 IST 2016, its a rule besides he just tweeted a thank you to the njdevils for their pre game ceremony for mike nichols
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:21:37 IST 2016, i heard cant see it from the heavens here
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:20:30 IST 2016,miller got tossed for putting on the foil nyrvsnjd
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:18:18 IST 2016,njdeviils will start the 3rd period with 459 of power play time
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:16:44 IST 2016,i didnt see what miller did to deserve a match penalty but thats a huge break for the njdeviils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:14:17 IST 2016, or to have him off the ice for 5 minutes in the 3rd period
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:13:17 IST 2016,kalinin  miller give the fans more to scream about not the usual combatants nyrvsnjd
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:11:49 IST 2016,2 quick thoughts on 2nd period rangers clearly miss mcdonagh  staal in back  njdevils played like the desperate team they are
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:08:50 IST 2016,njdeviils get away with a pick rangers get away with a hook  stempniak beats lundqvist for a 3-2 lead
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:02:12 IST 2016,both goalies have been outstanding tonight stats be damned nyrvsnjd
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 07:00:51 IST 2016, tbh he has a hard time staying upright in general hes always on the ice that wasnt even a penalty on mcilrath
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:52:30 IST 2016,blandisi failed on his 1st attempt to go to palmieri on opposite side of crease  rangers cleared connected with palms on 2nd try 2-2 game
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:49:45 IST 2016,at least njdevils are putting up a fight good pressure results in rangers penalty
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:47:06 IST 2016,highway robbery by henrik on palmieri
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:39:05 IST 2016,gionta cant buy one missed the net from 10 feet out in front njdevils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:15:59 IST 2016,njdevils were better in last 10 minutes of 1st period but they deservingly trail 2-1
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:12:57 IST 2016,kalinin has been the njdevils best forward so far
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 06:02:47 IST 2016,blandisi  kalinin swap lines njdevils
SteveLichtenst1,Wed Feb 24 05:54:01 IST 2016,njdevils down 2-1  reeling other than their goal theyve barely possessed the puck in the rangers zone
