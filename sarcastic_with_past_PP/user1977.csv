_JamesSteward_,Sat Feb 27 12:43:11 IST 2016,shopping cntr parking arse about prioritize car convenience to shops but inconvenient for ppl walking from car to shop 1/2
_JamesSteward_,Sat Feb 27 06:47:13 IST 2016,   istm that a bad road is made worse by a lane that starts  stops
_JamesSteward_,Sat Feb 27 02:48:09 IST 2016,the way  does bike lanes i agree 
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 14:04:59 IST 2016,   duncan gay has gone too far pls support disallowance  be part of the solution 
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 12:41:41 IST 2016,  and again wont reach for a bell when i need both hands on brakes and steering duty
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 12:40:58 IST 2016,  unless you mean from motorists my voice has averted a few likely collisions doubt theyd hear a bell
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 12:39:41 IST 2016,  dont recall any  if something unexpected happens the last thing id reach for is a bell

_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 10:59:14 IST 2016,dear  please tell vince punaro that this is an epic failure 
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 10:00:11 IST 2016, for the cyclists it is rarely their fault  
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:58:12 IST 2016, hmm  thats got me thinking maybe a vacuum cleaner in the inlet pipe -
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:56:22 IST 2016,   maybe handy should you be on your way to a bbq -
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:55:33 IST 2016,along with massive and unjustifiable fine increases etc  mandatory id coming your way soon   
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:53:32 IST 2016,   yes ive just emailed sgt mike    about the issue its ridiculous
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:51:56 IST 2016,  near 30 years of cycling without a bell and no pedestrians endangered obviously my bike doesnt need one
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:49:50 IST 2016,   i have never been stopped for a random road worthiness check of my car or bike

_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 08:02:55 IST 2016,all those hard hats  must have been dropbears in the area 
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 07:38:04 IST 2016,andrew    time to lobby for review of the law imo
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 07:37:06 IST 2016,andrew   common sense would say yes but  believes not if law applied in bw -
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 07:05:22 IST 2016, i wonder if police will be out in force at say the next grafton to inverell road race bikes have to be road worthy
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 06:28:12 IST 2016, sad indeed no mention of helmet so presume was wearing one - that failed to do its job -/
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 04:57:20 IST 2016,rt  helmet have zero impact on people cycling some say not what those who dont cycle say 
_JamesSteward_,Fri Feb 26 01:12:09 IST 2016, interesting that humans can provide turn and stop signals but not warning sounds dont you think
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 17:11:21 IST 2016, so while im attached to the bicycle via clips on pedals  shoes im not a part of it amazing act thinks to relax while nsw
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 13:51:10 IST 2016, can you imagine a person who might have had a drink suddenly drinking enough to get 049 bac b4 driving when that law came in
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 13:21:48 IST 2016,  does your friend feel safer now
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 12:44:17 IST 2016,   details link
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 12:43:55 IST 2016, does bn have evidence that drivers who give more than 1/15m passing dist already will reduce to minimum if law is enacted
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 12:20:52 IST 2016,rt  restrict visibility and prevent cyclists and pedestrians from working out whether drivers have spotted them https/â€¦
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 12:09:33 IST 2016,   road law states or similar warning device in working order has anyone tested voice in court
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:37:22 IST 2016,  its all about power ffs
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:36:36 IST 2016, was thinking most had a licence  lost it due to law breaking rather than never had one at all could b wrong 
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:29:14 IST 2016,  i never said their whining was rational -
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:26:26 IST 2016,  belot  and  is considering a relaxation of mhlgo shane
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:16:32 IST 2016, like a  door-away bike lane compromise when shop owners squeal too loud about losing car spaces
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 11:14:54 IST 2016,   and they have licences are registered and fined for disobedience but that doesnt seem to help
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:52:39 IST 2016, assume driving on right side of road and no shoulder also might modify lane pos depending on immediate circumstances
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:49:58 IST 2016,scroggsie   always thanks  you too
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:25:41 IST 2016,scroggsie  
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:22:51 IST 2016,scroggsie  btw a fall from 2 stories upl you have well and truly exceeded a bicycle helmet limitations -
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:21:10 IST 2016,scroggsie  1/helmets r designed for simple falls to ground2/helmet promoters know capabilities exceeded in crash w/ car
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:18:20 IST 2016,scroggsie    4/ more cyclists on roads gives government reason to build dedicated infra best
_JamesSteward_,Thu Feb 25 10:17:29 IST 2016,scroggsie    3/ with more ppl cycling there are more cyclist drivers who drive better
