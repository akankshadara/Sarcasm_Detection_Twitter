THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 13:36:49 IST 2016,rt da fe fates has cool features like customizing what your avatar says in castle battles and making dumb people angry 
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 13:36:38 IST 2016,everyones been talking about damn daniel today and i looked it upwhy is it a thing its so dumb
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 12:45:14 IST 2016, a simple not a fan wouldve sufficed jeez
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 12:35:44 IST 2016, if the canucks management looked at possession stats we wouldnt still have sbisa/bartkowski/etc
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 12:07:05 IST 2016,rt  im worried hutton might have too much personality for the canucks  
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:56:26 IST 2016,rt  hutton just won most exciting player with that performance
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:52:37 IST 2016,lrt ben hutton is my new favourite canuck
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:52:15 IST 2016,rt  must see ðŸŽ¤canucks diceandice lypsyncbattle 
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:34:09 IST 2016, john tortorella was also an aquilini pick for coach though i still think the canucks were pretty decent that year just unlucky
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:33:35 IST 2016, for example after losing in 2011 the aquilinis pushed gillis to build more like the team that beat him
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:32:50 IST 2016, i can only hope its soon but linden has a ton of trust in him for some reason and ownership hasnt been all that great either
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:29:57 IST 2016, bennings been gm for not even two full seasons and theres a huge list of really stupid mistakes hes madethats absurd
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:29:09 IST 2016, worst trade theyve made but theyve made a ton of dumb signings or waiver claims or minor league assignments
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:28:15 IST 2016, problem with vancouver is that this isnt the only time theyve screwed up really badly nor is it the most egregious
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:22:02 IST 2016, i know thats what i said im pretty sure
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:21:03 IST 2016, theyve all beaten it before you were late to the party remember
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 11:20:00 IST 2016, dont worry i know you werentdoesnt make the deal any less stupid god i hate the canucks management group
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:44:49 IST 2016,  i still dont see whats so bad about it compared to other localizations
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:37:02 IST 2016,  regardless of the reason it was gonna happen and someone was gonna complainjust chill
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:36:37 IST 2016,  a secret almost every game from japan that gets localized loses something in translationfates is no different
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:33:54 IST 2016,  as for dialogue being cut that also happens a lot i dont see the issue
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:33:34 IST 2016,  a lot of nintendo games have dialogue like that first one that comes to mind is pokemon diamond/pearl
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:26:56 IST 2016,  what about the game is so different aside from thatis it the soleil thing because some changes are for the better
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 10:01:09 IST 2016,  oh boohoo you cant pet everyones faces
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:39:12 IST 2016,  asset management isnt his forte not only that but he thinks good in scrums is worth 36 million a year
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:38:06 IST 2016, its one of my favourite games ever made
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:24:41 IST 2016, np hope you enjoy the series its so good
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:24:00 IST 2016, yo check their website good shit
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:22:30 IST 2016,  asset management as a whole hasnt been good nor has his ability to gauge valuetrades/fas just an extension of that
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:21:23 IST 2016, wait rotom isnt a legendary i swear it was
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:13:59 IST 2016,  who knows they could still turn around do good thingsi just dont have hope
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:09:47 IST 2016,  thats unfortunately truei can only hope the lindenning era doesnt last much longer
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:09:00 IST 2016,  were a long time removed from cam neely but those who dont know their history are doomed to repeat it
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:06:28 IST 2016,  or the mistakes pile up until ownership gets rid of the guys currently in chargeeither way i wish shink the best
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:05:35 IST 2016,  if he prospers maybe the regime will notice they made a mistake and not make that same mistake in the future
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 09:00:07 IST 2016,  its less like yes this is something i truly want and more like i want the regimes bad decisions to bite them hard
THockeyGamer,Wed Feb 24 08:56:35 IST 2016, this is something taught in schoolsmonopolies are bad competition is healthy for businesses  consumersbasic capitalism
