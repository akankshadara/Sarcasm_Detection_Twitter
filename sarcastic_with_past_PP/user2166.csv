Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:54:29 IST 2016,i can’t wait for the epic love poem tweets like after gorges was dealt 
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:54:07 IST 2016,i’m really not broken up about weise going i like him but nowhere near to the extent that so many others do… wow some of these laments
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:52:40 IST 2016, you can have the 20 character guys who can’t score and never see a cup i’d rather see a cup
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:51:09 IST 2016, lol touché
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:50:54 IST 2016, yeah that’s how i read it too i really hate the word character to describe a player that’s how bad this has gotten for me
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:49:41 IST 2016,i’d rather have an asshole who can score 30 goals than another frigging character guy who can’t score 10
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:48:57 IST 2016,whenever someone lauds a player as a great character guy my first thought is “so he can’t score goals but mt will love him” conditioning
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:47:28 IST 2016, i still think 18 will be bad but whatever it’s pie in the sky to me because it’s so far away
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:46:17 IST 2016, i have no faith left and i’ve seen too many rumour tweets about dealing him
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:46:00 IST 2016,james he’s so fun to watch… or at least he was when i was in sj
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:45:27 IST 2016, but 2018 really and chicago always contends so it’ll be a low round 2nd
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:45:04 IST 2016, i don’t know that i was expecting anything in particular i’m more interested in the draft pick than danault who the fuck ever
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:44:07 IST 2016,who scarfs more hotdogs in the press box mccarron or ellis or are they trade bait i’m terrified they’ll deal mccarron trust is gone
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:43:07 IST 2016, i hate that carey covers up for a shit coach love carey but there’s a severe downside attached for me because he’s so great
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:42:10 IST 2016, i don’t like 99 of tv shows will stick to my books thanks
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:41:34 IST 2016, ah gotcha thanks
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:41:22 IST 2016, seriously won’t be watching if therrien is still coaching next season i’m done with this coach
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:40:54 IST 2016, thanks but so what seriously we have plenty of character apparently it’s not a selling point for me anymore
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:40:08 IST 2016, it usually is 
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:39:52 IST 2016,not going to google or gaf about danault another bottom 6 therrien style guy big whoop
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:39:10 IST 2016, yes i know but trading for therrien type players makes me think that he’s not going anywhere anytime soon 
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:38:31 IST 2016, danault seems like he’s cast from the same mould he’ll fit right in therrien will be fine with it i’m sure
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:37:41 IST 2016, seems we’re not going to get any offence ever we’re just going to get character defenders  therrien riding carey forever
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:36:03 IST 2016,it feels like bergevin is going to back therrien until the end of time it really does “no offence all defence” i’m so discouraged
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:35:28 IST 2016,now we just need to deal our two top line wingers and we can have 12 bottom 6 forwards who can all defend and whom therrien will adore
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:31:21 IST 2016,another guy who can’t score he’ll fit right in defending the tie or the one or two goal deficits 
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:30:30 IST 2016,as long as the important points are covered then 
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 08:28:06 IST 2016,sigh weise and fleischmann for another 4th liner and a low 2nd round pick i’m sure danault is a character guy though
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:58:54 IST 2016,rt kitv2 i just cant find younger guys attractive i like a man with some lines on his face
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:27:11 IST 2016,drinking bro’s rum out of his fancy hand blown ns crystal glass this is what you get for pilfering my habs mug
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:26:28 IST 2016, ah see i do because i’m not one to drink a lot of milk mostly just have it for tea sometimes cereal not often
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:26:06 IST 2016, exactly but i also think it’s kind of a cheat and i don’t like that at all
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:24:26 IST 2016, i buy from local dairy farmers and they have good milk usually lasts a few days past expiry lol
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:23:49 IST 2016,oooooh a price update our season is saved mt is safe hellno areyouserious
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:22:51 IST 2016, on the rumour tweet things i agree but you gotta lay off the milk go for rotten eggs or something instead
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:22:26 IST 2016, well i think it’s another work around and i don’t like cheating cheaters who cheat it favours the smarter gms 😜
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:21:14 IST 2016, sometimes depending on the fridge and the quality of the milk milk can last a day or two past expiry harsh
Tygerlylly,Sat Feb 27 05:19:34 IST 2016,i want the cba changed so there are no salary retentions for trades if he’s got an insane cap hit teams must pay the sticker price
