Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 15:08:13 IST 2016,n11 no id rather wait until cellino is gone any replacement will be another underwhelming yes man doing cellinos bidding lufc
Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 14:29:25 IST 2016, 2 dream scenarios-1a rich local owner 2 bring back grayson however i get the feeling cellino will stick around to spite us

Jimbo_G_81,Sun Feb 21 00:28:51 IST 2016, lets just keep chipping away at cellino and the rest will fall into place
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:52:57 IST 2016, two traits that have abandoned us since cellino arrived
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:39:03 IST 2016, truehes useless but no self respecting manager will take a job under cellinohell just be replaced with same calibre manager
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:32:42 IST 2016,  oh no dont you remember there was the byram money and more
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 23:19:16 IST 2016, id also put evans in the category of not good enough
Jimbo_G_81,Sat Feb 20 22:04:59 IST 2016,i think im pretty much at the end of my patience with steve evans lufc

Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:26:57 IST 2016, i concur
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:19:38 IST 2016, do you think it could be cellino selling up or evans getting the old  heeve-ho at the end of the season and not giving him ¬£
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 22:02:39 IST 2016, as i said earlier these miserly bids being rejected will lead to a we tried to bring players in excuse on monday lufc
Jimbo_G_81,Fri Jan 29 16:14:12 IST 2016, a bid that low is designed for no more incomings  a shrug of the shoulders when the window closes saying ah well we tried
Jimbo_G_81,Thu Jan 28 18:45:54 IST 2016, this smells of either cellino selling up or replacing evans in the summer and giving no funds this window
