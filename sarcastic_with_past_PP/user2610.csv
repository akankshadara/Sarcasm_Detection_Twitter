MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 22:42:01 IST 2016,     oh but why it went so well this time 
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:19:44 IST 2016,fink   he apologized for his part but she never apologized for accusing him of murder nice cbs
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:13:55 IST 2016,  fink is that where she says goodbye and he says goodnight
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:11:38 IST 2016,  fink i saw he said that thats pretty strong feelings tony is the best and deserves to portrayed accordingly
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:09:14 IST 2016, fink thats true animosity is coming out of gg and mhs pores we smell from here
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:05:17 IST 2016,  fink oh brother what a mess
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:03:57 IST 2016, fink meaning before they met or bec she wanted a different outcome
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 09:01:04 IST 2016,fink  what happened in the last scene
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:46:55 IST 2016, yeah when i watch re-runs i see through different eyes now although he always annoyed me a lot
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:45:45 IST 2016,fink  cbs exactly karen its beyond ludricous
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:43:30 IST 2016, i will never again invest my time in a show where he or mh are involved stupid and in your face attitude is not appealing
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:40:26 IST 2016, exactly theres only one outcome acceptable but gg apparently only likes tony when hes on the ground being stomped on geez
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:38:14 IST 2016,   fink hes the only character we all equally love so lets treat him like dirt
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:34:50 IST 2016,  elsimunoz  amen to that nidane
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:33:59 IST 2016,  i guess this was a love letter to the jeanne and tony shipperssee how it feels tony feels like crap in both cases
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:30:44 IST 2016,  i do not understand why they do that to tony the last ep with jeanne in it was a good ending for both of them
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 08:20:47 IST 2016,fink    i havent watched it yet 2q who said they were soul mates and is tiva dead
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 05:46:31 IST 2016,cbs so youll make tony into a homewrecker and tarnish is reputation forever no thank you tiva is endgame always and forever
MelanieRizk,Wed Feb 24 05:40:17 IST 2016, cbs very good question why is this being re-visited exactly
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:32:44 IST 2016,    no arguments here time to pay up
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:28:08 IST 2016,    i agree not sure what the point is supposed to be well soon see
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:27:12 IST 2016,    take that promo pic and compare it to the original it almost identical
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:26:12 IST 2016,    we should have seen tony like that with ziva would have been fantastic
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:25:20 IST 2016,    i did love seeing tony is a relationship but she was irritating
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:23:57 IST 2016,    i think he did or he loved the idea of a normal relationship
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:23:10 IST 2016,    then why bring her back as married if thats their end game
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:19:19 IST 2016,    cant figure out how this plays to the end game besides clearing t of guilt
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:17:24 IST 2016,    because you know thats important to everyone that she feels better
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:16:53 IST 2016,    still dont think theyll cross the line just make jeanne feel better
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 23:16:02 IST 2016,    i doubt it his answer will be yes he loved her blah blah
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 22:40:45 IST 2016,   cbs  the extended promo makes me think theyre re-creating that moment
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 17:42:46 IST 2016, i doubt they will cross that line but they are promoting the possibility it is sad
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 06:34:53 IST 2016,ashaley thank you ash
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 01:01:19 IST 2016,rianna lol duhtotally mis-read your tweet thats a name of a book thanks for the heads up im looking for good books to read
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:54:37 IST 2016,rianna whats the context for this saying
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:46:34 IST 2016,cbs i cant wait for a timeline for ziva and tony youll need about 50 or more slides 4 months versus 8 plus years still waiting
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:33:35 IST 2016,   cbs nope  they for sure know and welcome it
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:30:59 IST 2016,   cbs have to put your two cents in when they open this door which they do for that reason
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:29:53 IST 2016,   cbs which i dont think most dotheyre are a few very vocal ppl who bend their ear against tiva
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:26:33 IST 2016,  cbs oh definitely on a personal note i would trade places with her in a heartbeat
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:25:08 IST 2016,  cbs lol thats an understatement
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:23:30 IST 2016,  agree they dont get any pr unless it has to do with t with anyone theyll get a lot more when we get a tiva history
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:19:17 IST 2016,  i really think this is a clearing the history and a goodbye episode
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:17:44 IST 2016,  cbs and apparently her husband knows about their history i wonder if hes the one to ask tony to talk with her
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:15:58 IST 2016,  cbs the premise that jeanne and dinozzo had a relationship is incorrect jeanne and dinardo had one
MelanieRizk,Tue Feb 23 00:06:30 IST 2016,cbs so youre promoting adultery now anyone or thing except ziva  right wrong - tiva was promoted and promised payoff is expected
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 04:12:03 IST 2016,fink  ashaley  thats what i thought but who knows
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 03:33:19 IST 2016, ashaley  im sorry but no good looking male to replace a good looking male boy that will keep the fans happy not
MelanieRizk,Mon Feb 22 03:14:06 IST 2016,ashaley  i heard one man one woman not enough to make up for his and zivas loss
MelanieRizk,Sun Feb 21 23:39:40 IST 2016,  same for us love michael the man and tony the character thank you for writing such a dynamic and loveable character
