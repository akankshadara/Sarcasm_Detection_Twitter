Dadov3,Thu Mar 24 07:07:15 IST 2016, but hes good on paper and he came from the spurs 
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 09:40:39 IST 2016,sportz  yea i feel sorry for knick fans
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 05:33:00 IST 2016,kingdom realistic shooting guards that want to come to sacramento not too many
Dadov3,Wed Mar 23 05:29:34 IST 2016,sportz  that would be nice give the smaller markets a chance
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:43:59 IST 2016, ham i just realized i asked about rondo i meant mclemore  oops
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:32:06 IST 2016, ham isnt just a wrist thing  is it broken fractured
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:30:51 IST 2016, non issue forward people
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:26:19 IST 2016, knicks and lakers set to pursue every single  good free agent
Dadov3,Tue Mar 22 01:24:27 IST 2016,ham man what is wrong with rondo
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 22:32:38 IST 2016, ham yes but do the knicks what him  didnt woj mention on radio nobody wants rondo
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:41:02 IST 2016,  im thinking if rondo goes rudy follows suit or vice versa  then i have no idea what cuz does
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:38:36 IST 2016,voisin starts with their solid ownership front office and a little lucksee 1997 1 overall draft pick
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:33:52 IST 2016, if other teams humans had as many distractions as kings teams humans those teams would be in a world of hurt too
Dadov3,Sun Mar 20 09:31:12 IST 2016,voisin i think kings would be a ok if they had owners and front office comparable to spurs
Dadov3,Sat Mar 19 22:22:50 IST 2016, franchise is dysfunctional starting from the top once ownership is stable front office coaching is positively taken care of
Dadov3,Sat Mar 19 09:58:54 IST 2016, hopefully a whole lot differentfresh start
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 20:48:56 IST 2016,kingdom unless kings start over please no more young players
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 08:38:26 IST 2016,  it changes once ownership front office are on same page to do something different  dont see that happening
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 07:04:58 IST 2016,  hoping to see a functional product but unless vivek leaves his ego at the doordisfunctionalbballops
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 06:23:06 IST 2016,  ok but he needs some serious help
Dadov3,Fri Mar 18 06:21:59 IST 2016, so next year well be saying wait till next year and the season after that  season after that and so on
Dadov3,Wed Mar 16 08:51:18 IST 2016,ham if those 2 players were in the east yes
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 23:54:00 IST 2016,   not even close  2022playoffs
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 04:57:41 IST 2016,c but were only x amount of games from the 8th seed
Dadov3,Mon Mar 14 04:54:00 IST 2016,  depends what cuz wantscircus isintown
Dadov3,Sun Mar 13 05:40:12 IST 2016, that 20-23 record was very misleading
Dadov3,Sun Mar 13 04:53:05 IST 2016, organization is in desperate need of consistency  have to keep coach and cuz 1 more season see where it takes them
Dadov3,Thu Mar 10 13:48:48 IST 2016, worse didnt vlade mortgage kings future 
Dadov3,Thu Mar 10 13:23:49 IST 2016,nba cuz single handedly lost the game  great individual stats took a step back with lack of positive  attitude poise/leadership
Dadov3,Mon Mar 07 06:30:40 IST 2016,medina zero  really not literally i guess
Dadov3,Sun Mar 06 07:46:30 IST 2016,jasonjones live him but i dont think thats a winning recipe
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 07:59:43 IST 2016,  i think youre on to something there
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 00:34:34 IST 2016,  wo there cowboy on this team debatable but on most considerable  playoff teams not really
Dadov3,Fri Mar 04 00:32:18 IST 2016,  i feel you its only a start  btw i watch my fair share
Dadov3,Thu Mar 03 11:33:31 IST 2016, not sure a coach is going to change culture of this team a well rounded starting 2 and 4 will  stein is not a starter yet
Dadov3,Wed Mar 02 11:22:25 IST 2016,  2/10
Dadov3,Tue Mar 01 22:50:04 IST 2016,  well gosh that makes me feel so much better trade him
Dadov3,Tue Mar 01 22:49:12 IST 2016,  could have said that when they went 12-20 and lost to philly and troy daniels
Dadov3,Mon Feb 29 01:39:03 IST 2016, geeeee let me think
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 22:45:01 IST 2016, jasonjones as much as it takes these owners are billionaires
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 22:44:35 IST 2016,jasonjones  no i dont think they will but i hope
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 10:02:57 IST 2016, yep and he already is now lets get a good gm the right coach with the right players and vice versa
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:58:40 IST 2016, wow about 10 separation there  that picture explains all the losses i guess
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:56:59 IST 2016, i believe kings were 12-18 or close to that and philly was coming up
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:53:34 IST 2016, i think thats before they lost to philly at home not positive though
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:52:15 IST 2016, come on dave even napier mentioned on radio he didnt think kings could recover if they went 12-20
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:50:33 IST 2016, all kings teams since 2006
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:48:45 IST 2016, new gm new coach new and better players for cuz and well be alright
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:47:15 IST 2016, well according to the nba ref it is probably called an offensive foul in college
Dadov3,Wed Feb 24 09:37:54 IST 2016, i actually disagree those acting shooting attempts are called often
