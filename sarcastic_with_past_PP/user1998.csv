LeafsJaysFan,Sun Feb 28 02:20:59 IST 2016,franchise history  lol not even close  
LeafsJaysFan,Sat Feb 27 20:09:30 IST 2016,very talented 
LeafsJaysFan,Sat Feb 27 18:12:03 IST 2016,start of a golden age in toronto sports - well the leafs are a bit behind the curve but will get there believing 
LeafsJaysFan,Sat Feb 27 03:58:28 IST 2016, in what respect
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 21:25:55 IST 2016,probably pretty close tbh   
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 21:22:30 IST 2016,yep i agree  i know that ee and jb are two totally different cats  im not so critical of jbbut still a bit 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 20:31:12 IST 2016,yeah thats what jb said and then a day later its like oh as long as i get whatever i want 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 20:19:46 IST 2016,the great movement of   is he talking about the bowel type  that would make sense 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 20:16:58 IST 2016,get it done even if it means that theres no money left for jb 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:42:53 IST 2016, no we dont need it  my only point was how much more imposing itd be
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:38:13 IST 2016,dont get me wrong i dont have any issues about saunders other than health but i dont think hes as imposing 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:37:48 IST 2016,i agree about his last couple of years  not sure that saunders is in the same category though   
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:32:03 IST 2016,  
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:30:16 IST 2016,dont need - probably right but his power/production isnt close to bruces  was just looking at the addt thunder 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:25:36 IST 2016,yep - that was the other thing i was thinking of youre right 
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:21:46 IST 2016,i know that bruce may not have been the best alternative but i can just imagine adding that bat to the lineup too lol
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:20:51 IST 2016,blue nothing shallow about admiring someones looks just the fact that you question his character shows youre not
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:19:55 IST 2016,last year was an anomaly for tulo i think hell be back to himself this year
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:18:33 IST 2016,might not be you just never know  
LeafsJaysFan,Fri Feb 26 18:17:56 IST 2016,as impressive as the offense was add in tt and what he can do along with travis  offense is just scary good 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 22:54:24 IST 2016,good signing - could be the next real low cost possible big reward just like baut  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 22:43:30 IST 2016,hes going to borrow one of they guys scooters for mound visits  gibbythebest 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 18:02:12 IST 2016,absolutely  this is the year  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 17:55:58 IST 2016,  i think too that sometimes just the change in an org can change a guy maybe itd be good for him
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 17:55:19 IST 2016,  not saying its impossible but theres no guarantees some guys are just flakes  lad havent been able to
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 15:27:07 IST 2016,thanks for sharing - great read 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 15:20:03 IST 2016,and the impact of adding someone like him and possible ensuing drama has to be considered 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 15:19:29 IST 2016,the important thing to ask though is would he fit in the clubhouse  what there is now seems to be a great group 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 15:17:38 IST 2016,itll be a shame he really is the face of the franchise but yeah not like its the first time a player has left 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 07:27:45 IST 2016,yeah he is  would be nice to hope he could mature but dunno  seems his nature  talented player  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 07:10:50 IST 2016,well yeah  but would the two arms supposedly be lol  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 07:01:59 IST 2016, hope you get hit by a bludger

LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:22:42 IST 2016,been following  from the very beginning  you can bet that when he makes it ill for sure buy his jersey
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:19:45 IST 2016,its most definitely and intriguing trio - real mix and crossover of skills 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:17:41 IST 2016,yeah it is  considering he has so little pro experience and hes the 25th best prospect in milb 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:14:41 IST 2016, moving on up and getting noticed  wont be long now until hes in the show 
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:13:34 IST 2016,well done  keep that grind going  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:11:36 IST 2016,i do too  id miss him big time real leader and classy guy but as he himself said its just business  
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 04:10:53 IST 2016, thats darned scary - dont understand how someone can drive drunk like that once let alone cheat to do it repeatedly
LeafsJaysFan,Thu Feb 25 03:09:34 IST 2016, have you reported this to the police  seems like something that shouldnt be ignored

LeafsJaysFan,Wed Feb 24 23:39:49 IST 2016,okay then alls good then lets just through it around willy-nilly sure the shareholders wont mind  peace  
LeafsJaysFan,Wed Feb 24 23:38:25 IST 2016,right - to my point - the luxury tax can be a concern not so much when a team barely exceeds the limit 
LeafsJaysFan,Wed Feb 24 23:36:32 IST 2016,how much have the yankees increased payroll by this winter
