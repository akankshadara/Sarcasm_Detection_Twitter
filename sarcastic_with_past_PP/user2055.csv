bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:42:21 IST 2016,  no guard play  cant win close games  recipe for a long run in march  
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:38:45 IST 2016, havent won a close game all year  guard play is terrible  tell me again how this means little heading into march
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:31:30 IST 2016, we couldnt have thought this team would go far with gabe pjc and kadeem  have to rebuild the backcourt
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:26:49 IST 2016, the guard play on this team continues to be a major problem-cant win late in the year without it
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:15:33 IST 2016, here we go  another close one
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:11:44 IST 2016, pjc is out of it  kadeem is out of control  gabe cant get anything going  guard play  cant win without it
bhellman,Sun Feb 28 02:00:39 IST 2016, its not because there was no way it would be for him
bhellman,Fri Feb 26 05:49:31 IST 2016, because it doesnt happen to any other school   is the best program in the  and only team worth storming
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:45:40 IST 2016, 6 losses by 21 total points problem with that is 6 losses by 21 total points  gotta win some of the close ones
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:32:34 IST 2016, pg play only thing holding this team back from making a real run
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 09:28:37 IST 2016, not sure the zues reverse layup was the call right there
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 08:49:24 IST 2016, millers been working on that t for a few weeks
bhellman,Thu Feb 25 08:22:49 IST 2016, pg play  when its good its good but when its bad its like this
bhellman,Fri Feb 19 02:00:38 IST 2016, how is  10 in bpi 12 in kenpom but a 5 in your bracketology
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 10:32:06 IST 2016, really interesting how things have changed pjc is shooting the 3 not turning it over and kadeem is playing well off the ball
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 09:39:12 IST 2016, 61 in the 2nd half  this time we actually couldve had one of those tale of two halves games and been ok with it
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 09:06:12 IST 2016, and he didnt throw up either
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:14:01 IST 2016, ryan anderson has touched the ball twice on offense but weve taken 8 threes who cares if we lead the conf in 
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:13:20 IST 2016, ryan anderson has touched the ball twice on offense but weve taken 8 threes they really dont pay attention to the details
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:09:35 IST 2016, maybe someone wants to guard the 3 point line since thats all this team does
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:06:15 IST 2016, theres absolutely no sense of urgency
bhellman,Thu Feb 18 08:05:00 IST 2016, this is our problem all year  we drift in and out of games
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 09:59:36 IST 2016, oh tiffers
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 09:16:39 IST 2016,rt  to pay tribute to bowie i wouldve  picked morrissey or bryan ferry or peter gabriel or iggy pop or david byrne well yâ€¦
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:14:37 IST 2016, assumed someone like you would get it without 
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:09:43 IST 2016, not with stevie wonder at the piano there arent
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 07:06:29 IST 2016, she did that xmas commercial that was on like a million times
bhellman,Tue Feb 16 02:44:31 IST 2016, saw your bracket zona wins 5 in a row and you move them down a spot  still 3 seeds below oregon who just lost 2 in a row
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:31:09 IST 2016,  could go out in the opening weekend just as easily too  not even miller knows what team will show game to game
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:28:24 IST 2016, yup he knows they can go out at anytime in the pac12 or ncaa or they can get on a good run  gotta be very frustrating
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:25:20 IST 2016, im kind of tired of miller having to use the tale of two halves line every game
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 09:23:23 IST 2016, getting tired of this whole tale of two halves story every game
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:55:19 IST 2016, 21-5 tied for 1st no bad losses injuries  millers really pieced this thing together maybe his best job considering all
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:47:42 IST 2016, thanks for waiting on zona  flawed team but have battled lately especially with the full roster in place
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:42:08 IST 2016, man that was an ugly half but a huge win  this is who we are  score a lot  give up a lot  battle
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:27:32 IST 2016, waiting on the zona-sc finish
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:22:15 IST 2016,  totally different zona team this year  never in a million years would you see them blow 16 pt lead at home before this yr
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:16:31 IST 2016, 32 points in 12 minutes  have to be able to put 2 halves together at some point
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 08:04:04 IST 2016, shooting way too many 3s with a double digit lead
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:49:17 IST 2016, exactly  missed those early 3s then figured it out
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:45:41 IST 2016, started the first half shooting too many 3s too  pretty sure not what miller wanted
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 07:31:38 IST 2016, the question is does miller know how to coach this team when they have a lead at half ha
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 06:58:49 IST 2016, would be nice to knock down a few though
bhellman,Mon Feb 15 06:54:22 IST 2016, heres an ideakeep pounding it inside and stop shooting 3s
bhellman,Sun Feb 14 04:46:32 IST 2016, and look who is tied in the loss column all of a sudden  huge game tomorrow
bhellman,Sat Feb 13 09:42:19 IST 2016, winning a game shooting like that from the floor from 3 and from the line is not something i thought they could do-big win
bhellman,Wed Feb 10 05:40:31 IST 2016, wasnt my point
bhellman,Wed Feb 10 05:27:01 IST 2016, come on  you spent 3 years in mckale
bhellman,Mon Feb 08 08:37:00 IST 2016,  hell get no credit for this win  almost like having an asterisk because of how bad he was
bhellman,Mon Feb 08 08:29:28 IST 2016,wkbw he left that drive in 2012
