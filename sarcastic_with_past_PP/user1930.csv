FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:09:09 IST 2016,hambazaza fade him
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:07:16 IST 2016,must stop tweaking epl lineups
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:02:27 IST 2016,   hambazaza spending on d seems to be the gpp way to go
FTC_21,Sat Feb 27 20:02:06 IST 2016,   hambazaza i have me some hazard
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 17:59:40 IST 2016, theres always one asshole who needs to pick the firs six out so he can see his name at the top

FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:19:59 IST 2016,loving the low ownership of citys attack in tues striker  will love it more if they do something
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:17:02 IST 2016,  ill know who to yell at then
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:14:58 IST 2016,  considered rostering one of them as a boom/bust but went safe  having no yaya scares me more
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:07:04 IST 2016, usually not a game logger but cant help but notice recent road performances for djackson are less than desirable
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:06:25 IST 2016,hambazaza gonna need it figured the barca fwds needed to go 30 to matter at their   messi hit i was close to a successful fade tho
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:05:03 IST 2016,hambazaza only played suarez in 1 of 5 lus  faded all barca and bayern pretty much so eggs in the city basket  ill likely be wrong
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 01:01:40 IST 2016, i have all the aguero and silva like  im convinced city goes on a tear tonight  and ill likely be wrong
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 00:57:34 IST 2016,hambazaza really  come on cl games first
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 00:56:01 IST 2016,finding all of my lineups falling on guardado for psv hope they get some corners today  dfs
FTC_21,Thu Feb 25 00:49:25 IST 2016, youre not alone on this
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 21:19:20 IST 2016,i love the poorly educated is trending thanks to people who are looking to be angry about something/ need to get the stick out of their ass
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 21:15:55 IST 2016, alex pick on lsu the rest of the way  cant see ben giving a shit about the rest of the season
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:47:48 IST 2016,alex hambazaza i have all the david silva
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:28:58 IST 2016,alex hambazaza good move might regret fading him but have this stupid suspicion about city tomorrow
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:21:28 IST 2016,alex hambazaza just couldnt pull the trigger on messi or muller  hoping aguero comes good have a little griezmann too
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:17:29 IST 2016,   youre arsenal fans fine ill leave you alone
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:11:13 IST 2016,   its okay boys theres still that all-important 4th place to set your sights on
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:10:13 IST 2016,what did caramel ever do to anyone 
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 03:08:25 IST 2016,um yeah 
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:56:32 IST 2016,its okay arsenal youre favorite 4th place spot is still there for the taking  arsfcb arsvsbar
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:53:40 IST 2016,hambazaza 5 lineups only barca forward i have is suarez in one of them  have one lineup with only dybala from today  liking that one
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:37:51 IST 2016,all the damn dybala
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:34:42 IST 2016,how does a team with juves pedigree allow robben to do just about the only thing he can do anymore 
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 02:33:18 IST 2016,so far the correct answer is bayern stack
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:47:14 IST 2016, the only footballer ive ever had hatred for
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:19:41 IST 2016,7 owned mandzukic works for me narrative
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:06:15 IST 2016, probably should consider fetal position and mass intoxication in leg 2
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:04:30 IST 2016, fetal position is probably more necessary when the play at the camp nou in leg 2
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:02:43 IST 2016, it wont be so bad im calling 1-1 and have almost no exposure to this game
FTC_21,Wed Feb 24 01:00:10 IST 2016, i surprisingly have very little exposure to the two games today  will leave it at that
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:48:07 IST 2016,alex  re alexis i think he can wait until this weekend lol
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:42:13 IST 2016, alex still have visions of how he abused david luiz in paris last year cant tell me mertesacker can do better
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:41:03 IST 2016, alex never said it wasnt risky out of the three if i did play one it would be suarez
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:38:15 IST 2016,alex  arsenal buoyed by beating bayern at home  barca rd of 16 away leg not always bearing fruit  2 reasons why
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:32:41 IST 2016,alex  its going to take at least 30 dk points and maybe 35 for messi  and if i think the game ends 1-1
FTC_21,Tue Feb 23 23:30:22 IST 2016, alex fixin to do somethin dumber than hell but im gonna do it anywayfading barcelonas front three
