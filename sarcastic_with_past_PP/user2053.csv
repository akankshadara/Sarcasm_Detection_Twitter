BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:52:16 IST 2016,eric staal would have scored that 
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:38:45 IST 2016,i can see us doing something so out of left field like getting shattenkirk opposed to getting staal way too many rumors going around staal
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:34:42 IST 2016,seguin and benn have 64 goals combined what the holy hell
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:33:44 IST 2016, that was my reaction too i was like wtf
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:30:56 IST 2016, these are the types of trades we should be making hudler was a steal a 2nd and a 4th in 3 drafts from now
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:29:08 IST 2016, what the hell did they trade for kindl
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:28:53 IST 2016,i was expecting to see marc playing with eric by deadline not this way though i wanted eric on the team like 5 years ago not now
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:21:43 IST 2016,i love how ranger fans are just expecting the inevitable of seeing estaal in a rangers jersey monday its a really bad sign for an org
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:19:50 IST 2016, they also got that hunt kid tjat was a free agent
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:18:45 IST 2016,i have a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach that rangers are going to do something extremely stupid worse than duclair last year
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:17:01 IST 2016,the only way i trade kreider lindberg and skjei is if they give us staal and skinner and eat half of skinners contract
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:13:45 IST 2016, eric staal for something involving kreider supposedly
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:12:57 IST 2016,  same
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:11:09 IST 2016, yandle last year was out of left field we heard about marty
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 02:10:21 IST 2016,wouldnt couldnt trade for purcell either for a 3rd round pick what is wrong with the rangers why must you insist on giving up roster piece
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:59:32 IST 2016,im not sure why rangers need a goalie unless we are trading hank
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:53:13 IST 2016,  same exact feeling
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:52:38 IST 2016,  didnt it come the day of the deadline
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:52:09 IST 2016, im not sure why you doubted it to begin witj
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:47:42 IST 2016, okay then ive heard like 4 different things
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:46:26 IST 2016, depends on your opinion on eric staal
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:46:02 IST 2016, rangers have 5m in cap come monday and both their contracts are probably like 4m combined
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:43:31 IST 2016, or versteeg
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:40:55 IST 2016,excuse me a 4th round pick from three drafts from now the rangers couldnt do that for hudler
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:38:56 IST 2016,if the only move the rangers make is replacing raanta they are in massive trouble also they have terrible understanding of what they need
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:34:19 IST 2016, you forgot stepan nash and hayes
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:33:52 IST 2016,rt  hudler for a seconderic staal for lindberg buchnevich lundqvist brassard and 85 1stsgorton be like nailed it
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:30:37 IST 2016,rt  when 1st shift workers see 2nd shift workers coming in to take their spot 
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:22:40 IST 2016,khalfin ranger what the hell is his name haha
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:21:15 IST 2016, that is probably what carolina started with
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 01:16:31 IST 2016,carolina wants kreider and lindberg/skjei rangers dont be dumb that is way too much of this year/next year to give up
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 00:33:50 IST 2016,khalfin  our untouchable dman
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 00:10:31 IST 2016, khalfin palmeri would have made a more sense he was nhl tested not flip flopped like etem
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 00:08:24 IST 2016,rt hl30 pls i dont want 2 staals i want 0
BlueshirtMac19,Sun Feb 28 00:04:30 IST 2016, khalfin stop adding fuel
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 23:54:15 IST 2016,does cespedes think hes bruce wayne or something 
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:58:43 IST 2016, why would we do that that is so counter productive
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:57:57 IST 2016,if we are giving canes kreider for staal we are dumb if its kreider  more for staalskinner then i would start listening
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:53:00 IST 2016,   it depends on what it is
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:51:19 IST 2016,if we get staal he better produce plain and simple we are going to lose yandleestaal one of hayesmiller or kreider if they arent traded
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:47:27 IST 2016,i hope yandle is actually off the market and he isnt traded for staal id be so upset if that were the case
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:45:26 IST 2016,  only difference is theyll be kicked in 1st round i hope
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:41:58 IST 2016,   you always have to think of now and the future unless you are chicago for some reason
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:39:34 IST 2016,  chris kreider probably cause rangers are dumb
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:38:25 IST 2016, a couple of people have said it this morning
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:37:49 IST 2016,why does laich make so much money id pick him up right away if he made like 2-3 less
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:36:26 IST 2016, im sorry someone needed to haha
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:35:23 IST 2016, could this be a staal tactic
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:34:56 IST 2016,ughhhhhhh dont trade kreider for staal its a terrible mistake kreider is a consistent 20 goal scorer
BlueshirtMac19,Sat Feb 27 22:33:10 IST 2016, 4 of them
