AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:10:51 IST 2016,you know what blatt was clearly the problem it had nothing to do with the cavs players 
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:09:27 IST 2016, i imagine ill be turning it off by halftime this team is gutless
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:07:55 IST 2016, theyre going to be playing toronto without home court and at this moment the raptors are better
AndyResnik,Mon Feb 29 00:05:25 IST 2016,im sorry but theres no way this cavs team can win it all i guess they have time to figure it out but they wont
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 23:58:36 IST 2016,the cavs cant freaking shoot or defend in transition i hate this team i really and truly hate it
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 23:04:04 IST 2016, congrats i was figuring on omar
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 22:55:37 IST 2016,when the cavs have to win game 7 of the ecf in toronto i hope lebron realizes all the crap he has done wrong this year
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 22:40:04 IST 2016, tony bernazard
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 22:23:19 IST 2016, im now at that point its never going to happen
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:55:01 IST 2016,after indians lost 1995 world series and after cavs lost 2007 finals i actually thought a title was only a matter of time man im dumb
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:53:15 IST 2016,when lebron came back i never thought a steph curry injury would be the cavs best chance at a ring why did i forget im from cleveland
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 21:49:40 IST 2016,although i wont be successful today would be a good day to start avoiding the cavs until april
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 10:04:32 IST 2016, life as a cleveland fan in all three sports theres always someone or some team thats just a little better
AndyResnik,Sun Feb 28 09:56:47 IST 2016,no way anyone is beating the warriors four out of seven unless curry gets hurt so last nights cavs loss meant nothing after all
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:56:31 IST 2016,lebron loves to bitch at teammates and refs but who calls him out for turnovers iso offense and lazy d no one 
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:52:18 IST 2016,the players also take their emotional cues from lebron they go as he goes which shows what a terrible leader he is 
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:13:59 IST 2016, i just tried that with his three tweets and only part of the first one would translate
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 22:12:52 IST 2016, in google type translate and then copy and paste the tweet thats in spanish
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 20:51:41 IST 2016,im still trying to wrap my head around last nights game but once again  capsulizes cavs perfectly 
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 10:12:07 IST 2016,this made me smile after tonights latest cavs debacle 
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:34:55 IST 2016,im still baffled by that fourth quarter from the cavs and this team in general its such a weird season
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:17:34 IST 2016,champions possess mental toughness and a determination to work together as a team for a common goal i dont see those traits from the cavs
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:15:02 IST 2016, how can a team led by lebron james be mentally soft oh thats right its because lebron is a terrible leader
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:13:30 IST 2016, i soured on them the moment they got blatt fired it doesnt feel like a team in the true sense of the word theyre babies
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:09:50 IST 2016, as i tweeted a few minutes ago im getting no enjoyment from this season i dont like how they play or their attitudes
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 09:05:13 IST 2016, im 999 percent sure they wont win it last year i was 999 percent sure they would
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:59:14 IST 2016,i never thought id get so little enjoyment from a good cleveland team but thats how i feel about the cavs only a title is acceptable
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:51:29 IST 2016,the cavs will have to figure out a way to stop lowry and beat toronto in 6 because something tells me the raptors will have home court
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:43:26 IST 2016,i still cant believe the cavs never had lebron guard lowry in the fourth quarter something is just off with this team
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:42:26 IST 2016,it took a ridiculous game from lowry ridiculous officiating and a major choke from the cavs but still they never should have lost tonight
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:38:53 IST 2016,awful loss for the cavs especially if they dont end up finishing first in the east plus the raptors just got a huge confidence boost
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:33:04 IST 2016,in the playoffs lebron is going to have to guard lowry down the stretch the cavs guards cant stop him
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:31:11 IST 2016,terrible possession on defense and then offense with the game on the line
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:18:54 IST 2016,id say that lowry is going to win this for the raptors by himself but the three refs are playing a role too
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:17:08 IST 2016,the cavs are coming unglued again
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:14:27 IST 2016,the refs got a call right
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:12:30 IST 2016, this is one of those games where theyre equally terrible for both teams its been really bad
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:11:17 IST 2016, why would the refs start making correct calls now
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:08:21 IST 2016,the refs have been making stuff up all night and theyre probably going to decide this game
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:04:55 IST 2016,this officiating is embarrassing
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 08:01:10 IST 2016,it took the cavs 90 seconds to come unglued
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:59:15 IST 2016,is part of the reason nba refs are so bad is that theyre so much shorter than most players and thus have trouble following some plays
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:53:21 IST 2016,that will be a flagrant 1 on delly because of dellys reputation
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:44:04 IST 2016,the refs are so bad in this game tonight bad calls both ways and a lot of them
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:41:34 IST 2016, i think kyrie is still rebuilding the strength in that knee which is why he isnt shooting as well
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:39:49 IST 2016,kyrie is off his game tonight and the cavs are up 12
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:30:46 IST 2016, great play by scola there was no foul
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:21:20 IST 2016,nba officiating is terrible period
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 07:09:29 IST 2016,sometimes plus-minus is meaningless in the nba tonight isnt one of those nights lebron is 16 kyrie is -9
AndyResnik,Sat Feb 27 06:57:59 IST 2016,10canbananamilk  started the second quarter with five bench players
