EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:36:06 IST 2015,mav is tipping we keep hearing that so thanks for the tip as  response to german andy weir sounds strange use your synonyms
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:28:53 IST 2015,catching myself i know what an orbital maneuvering system does but does generalreader thirdperson narrator could have helped explain
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:09:14 IST 2015,ive got one trick do real astronauts store up crazy emergency maneuvers they call tricks or had andy been watching too much firefly
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 22:02:50 IST 2015,martinez has to mansplain basic mav attributes to andy weir no 4 to get him to shut up hysteria driven exposition is a thing i guess
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:56:54 IST 2015,that was my 1000th tweet if i had a dollar for everytime they killed me in this thing i wouldnt have to work for you deke blammo
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:53:04 IST 2015,watney just as 70s as his much maligned commander obviously a result of weirvoice another example of why dialog practice necessary
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 21:34:17 IST 2015,file this under unintentional research watching rocky3 found source of kill you to death watney re rtg danger 70s weirvoice
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:53:07 IST 2015,look andy weir didn’t make this a ladycharacter in spite of hysteria beck mansplains things to women  other men like only a dude can
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:50:09 IST 2015,beck hysterical over watney’s death wants to let mav fall over strand everyone on mars bc he has feelings who’s irrational now
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:46:02 IST 2015,andy weir no 4 tries to soothe lewis into rational thinking acceptance of watney’s death silly beck ladies are irrational by nature
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:41:02 IST 2015,“i don’t feel good about this” i presume andy weir no 4 is delivering an homage to starwars here a clumsy homage at best
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 05:33:28 IST 2015,irrational commander working her way through electromagneticspectrum in her “grasping” search suggests radar to great male disapproval
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:26:07 IST 2015,the representations of lewis as incompetent  irrational continue to build not a strongfemalecharacter—a woman who fails at a man’s job
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:22:01 IST 2015,if crew suspicious that commander not thinking rationally to the point of forgetting obvious facts then maybe insubordination in order
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:20:03 IST 2015,in same breath that he dismisses commander’s “grasping” vogel insists crew follow her orders to prep to depart possibly without lewis
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:16:05 IST 2015,i cannot in good conscience consider this a bechdelwin too many significant qualifying factors against it bechdelfail ladywriting
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:12:07 IST 2015,while 2-line exchange technically not directly about a man still indirectly about watney  declared inane by all men present bechdeltest
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:10:02 IST 2015,johanssen silent as men declare that lewis forgets obvious facts bc she’s “grasping” as in losing rationality in crisis ladywriting
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:08:06 IST 2015,using more  this time repetitive character trait exposition in dialog men remind us that lewis is a geologist  should know better
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:05:04 IST 2015,lewis asks johanssen if infrared light will help her search through storm two men present immediately note that this is a stupidquestion
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 03:03:01 IST 2015,hey we finally have a lady asking a lady to explain something it’s not about a man but i don’t qualify this as a bechdeltest win yet
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:57:02 IST 2015,how would drawing lines magically help her walk straight why isn’t lewis using shiny homing devices like everyone else consistency
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:55:05 IST 2015,i’ve read this paragraph 4 times  i still have no idea why it wasn’t cut if she can’t see the ground dragging lines in sand won’t help
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:52:05 IST 2015,lewis cannot see the ground drags drill bits behind her for 20 meters then retraces her steps discovers she cannot walk straight line
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:48:04 IST 2015,no idea why or how lewis gets drill bits “from her back” which i should note shouldn’t be so easy in a sandstorm that buries her feet
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:42:03 IST 2015,re lewis unnecessary distracting to use “remembering something” to preface character’s actions this is understood remember economy
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 02:36:03 IST 2015,lewis commands crew into mav while she continues to look for watney presumably to return his body not overexplained for once martianwin
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:35:08 IST 2015,so much magic  dumbluck in constant success of instantly devised fixes except major catastrophes would love a few small failures
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:09:05 IST 2015,watney tinkers plenty—or would if he didn’t get everything right on the first try lewis’s “take off before it falls” also not tinkering
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 01:05:04 IST 2015,tinkering is a legitmate thing that people do in spacetravel problemsolving from co2 filters on apollo13 to parasol on skylab
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 00:59:02 IST 2015,mav can fall completely over if its sinking wouldnt it just keep sinking at this point i’d take trite exposition for an explanation
EditTheMartian,Tue Nov 17 00:57:03 IST 2015,mav tilted tilting more at gusts again is tilting stable if so is mav sinking i dont get the physics somebody mansplain it to me
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 23:53:23 IST 2015, for extra realism the ladycharacters would explain things to men who would then call them sexist names behind their backs
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 23:48:51 IST 2015, i hope youre being sarcastic if so astute observation reflecting our universe counteracts building strongfemalecharacters
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:38:08 IST 2015,my first recommendation would be to read  for example of how to write multigender scifi dialog free of mansplaining
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:33:06 IST 2015,read other scifi authors to see how they handle exposition in dramatic scenes without relying on crutch of men explaining stuff to women
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:28:01 IST 2015,ladycharacters ask men to explain stuff theyd likelyknow from training hard to do exposition but practice  research can help
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:24:07 IST 2015,so far men haven’t done much explaining anything to each other nor the women to each other nor women to men just men to women genderfail
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:21:04 IST 2015,johanssen reads code but beck translates lewis needs beck  martinez to explain things to her i get it’s exposition but its gendered
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 22:17:05 IST 2015,johanssen  lewis don’t know how anything works they do specific trained labor but ask men to explain tech stuff to them ladywriting
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 21:48:58 IST 2015,given johanssen cant see a thing she does remarkable digging thru telemetry code on her arm too bad she doesnt know what any of it means
EditTheMartian,Mon Nov 16 21:45:02 IST 2015,theyre doing complex stuff on arm computers in zero visibility storm hope these are tech spinoffs bc firefighters etc sure could use
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 20:28:35 IST 2015, no im not in the editing business anymore at least not professionally which is why im so snarky here unprofessional
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:18:06 IST 2015,basically watney forgets every baddecision lewis makes lays comprehensive blame on nasa he definitely has a crush on her barf
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:13:04 IST 2015,not only would watney not have been present to hear nasa’s abort message but he was there for lewis’s command that they prepare to abort
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:09:05 IST 2015,inconsistency martinez gets message from nasa to abort after watney hit on p4 watney says that nobody wanted to abort but nasa made them
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 05:02:04 IST 2015,martinez returns to mav to get abort message sent minutes earlier by nasa weird to send important direction somewhere it could be missed
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:50:01 IST 2015,johanssen of “i can’t see anything” a few sentences ago is now evaluating code on her armcomputer magic 
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:44:04 IST 2015,techreveal andy weir no 4 has an “arm computer” which he can see  read perfectly in middle of near zerovisibility storm
EditTheMartian,Sat Nov 14 02:36:06 IST 2015,maybe we’ll get a tilt explanation at exposition presser next time the narrative moves to earth come on let’s get it right this time
