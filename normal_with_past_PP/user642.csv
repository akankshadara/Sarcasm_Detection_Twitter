zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:21:32 IST 2016,sincerely a pissed off uber driver
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:21:17 IST 2016,again this is about whats fair the way how uber is treating their drivers is not just unfair it seems borderline illegal
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:20:42 IST 2016,and tip your drivers you are a stranger in somebodys car it costs on average 054/mile for us to drive our own cars between everything
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:19:38 IST 2016,if uber matches what we were making this time 16 months ago then well talk about me opening the door for someone
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:18:57 IST 2016,and after almost 1300 rides in the last year and a half i got a strike for not opening the door for somebody
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:18:22 IST 2016,oh and as a driver if you let a ride go no matter how far away it is it affects your acceptance rate even if the pickup point is 30 min
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:17:35 IST 2016,so take a look at those screenshots of the rides im talking about and tell me theyre not red red  surge plain and simple
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:16:52 IST 2016,i will not be taken advantage of without a fight 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:16:07 IST 2016,then april took over 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:15:19 IST 2016,
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:14:43 IST 2016,heres where i call bullshit on uber 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:14:09 IST 2016,
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:13:35 IST 2016,

zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:11:29 IST 2016,then there was this starting to repeat myself 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:09:32 IST 2016,the screenshots were all there not showing them here for privacy purposes 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:08:43 IST 2016,it already starts out bad by the driver having to play cat-and-mouse to search for a trip id number 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:07:38 IST 2016,it was supposed to say surge not surgeon damn autocorrect 
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:05:40 IST 2016,check out the emails ive been sending uber and the responses ive been getting it shouldve been a simple answer but then again who am i
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:04:17 IST 2016,i might be partially colorblind but that is fucking red it couldnt get more red than that i dont take photos of ride arrivals for fun
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:01:57 IST 2016,between my tweets yesterday and emailing back-and-forth uber is trying to convince me that these were in fact not surge rides
zacksonnenberg,Thu Feb 25 00:01:03 IST 2016,recently i had 2 rides in the glendale area that were clearly in red zones addresses altered for privacy look 
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:58:32 IST 2016,drivers thrive on being in areas that show up as red on a map that indicate a higher or surge rate especially these days
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:57:31 IST 2016,usually i wouldnt make this big of a deal over something like this but since the fares are now 080/mile  015/min average its enough
zacksonnenberg,Wed Feb 24 23:54:36 IST 2016,im glad there are drivers out there that do drive late at night because we need them i just fear for my safety and condition of my car
