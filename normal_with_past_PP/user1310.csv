Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:29:48 IST 2016, its a travesty conservative elites insist on pushing him out of the race when hes clearly the most electable and likeable
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:28:51 IST 2016, mainly from pundits he is clearly very smart but also ideologically flexible to an extent thats difficult to believe
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:22:03 IST 2016, at least chuka knew when to quit
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:21:33 IST 2016, am a kasich fan so still holding out hope jeb would have been an ideal candidate
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:16:41 IST 2016, i genuinely hope rubio isnt the nominee so it might be undue pessimism talking trump has exceeded expectations everywhere
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:15:29 IST 2016, its an exceptionally formidable coalition - both geographically and demographically not without weaknesses though
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:14:09 IST 2016, underperforms tomorrow rubio wins some states massive ad blitz in fl and two-man race going west - trumps weakest area
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:11:30 IST 2016, he does - and his exclusive dependence on the suburbs is a major obstacle going forward
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:07:30 IST 2016,  plus the jokes are so so bad - like ids 2003 conference speech bad

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:03:36 IST 2016, wed normally have seen some leaked internal polling by now unless they really are that good at managing expectations
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 05:02:52 IST 2016, i think this secret tape could hurt trump badly but unclear cui bono - him or cruz
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:55:20 IST 2016, could see that i simply cant believe that cruz would fare so badly in his home state or that rubio couldnt break 20
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:54:14 IST 2016, equally possible - its basically just a hunch i have
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:50:14 IST 2016, agreed i dont think it will be but emerson arent alone in having cruz narrowly ahead and rubio below 20
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:45:05 IST 2016,i maintain trump will underperform significantly tomorrow but i have no empirical basis for it whatsoever
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 04:42:27 IST 2016,if the final result is even remotely close to this i cant see how cruzs campaign goes much in to wednesday
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:57:17 IST 2016,  that paradox seems oddly familiar

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:51:34 IST 2016,  oh sure - they do exist trump has probably lulled them in to a false sense of electoral security

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:32:39 IST 2016,rt  sounds like secret tape might have trump saying what he said on the record to byron york  
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 03:29:01 IST 2016,flagrant disregard for journalistic ethics aside this whole secret tape story will damage trump far more than any other gaffe

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:30:37 IST 2016,  but they were conducted in the pre-yo mama phase of the campaign - could have been a gamechanger
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:29:11 IST 2016,  va demographically favourable to him though not that nv wasnt tbf
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:27:42 IST 2016,  youre probably right still find the paucity of polling staggering - did everyone assume it would be resolved
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:26:35 IST 2016,  definitely a possibility - though he has tended to outperform the polls nh notwithstanding
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:25:52 IST 2016, dc suburban growth is certainly trumps biggest problem there should perform well outside of nova
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:22:04 IST 2016, i do reckon rubio could win virginia - which would be a coup outside chance of ga too
Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:17:38 IST 2016, i tend to agree though it would vary depending on the state could swing nc and a few others to rubio

Americanist9,Tue Mar 01 02:15:41 IST 2016,guess would be that cruz wins tx by a sufficient margin to justify remaining in quite who that helps is difficult to say
