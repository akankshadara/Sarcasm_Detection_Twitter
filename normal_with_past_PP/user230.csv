cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:09:29 IST 2016,  peaceful discourse is meaningless if theres a constant threat of violence over your head
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:06:34 IST 2016,  i already said no not supporting your solution to racism / supporting racism
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:04:27 IST 2016,  prove rehab is the solution instead of convincing him peacefully youre assuming the proper solution
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:03:28 IST 2016,  okay you said before this was about restricted freedoms now you reversed it are you admitting youre wrong
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:00:37 IST 2016,  so their freedom wouldnt be restricted im glad we agree
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 14:00:12 IST 2016,  prove morally you or anyone else has the right to jail him
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:58:24 IST 2016,  oh youre a poe never mind
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:57:43 IST 2016,  right to freedom what are you on about what freedom was restricted she could walk away
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:56:47 IST 2016,   okay it was for humor prove its okay to jail someone for humor that you dont like
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:56:12 IST 2016,   is it moral no that doesnt mean that you should be caged for it
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:55:14 IST 2016,   the burden of proof is on you and the gov that they have the right to cage people for it
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:54:56 IST 2016,   thats not the question the question is about whether i can be put in a cage for it
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:54:30 IST 2016,   you dont know it was for humor he seemed very serious to me when did he say it was about a joke
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:50:48 IST 2016,   the question is whether the law is just not whether it exists why would anyone debate its existence
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:50:15 IST 2016,   thats not what i asked who said anything about humor
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:44:07 IST 2016,   should govs be able to assume someone might break the law and therefore reprimand or detain them
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:43:14 IST 2016,   right an assumption that his ideas or words would incite violence despite him not inciting violence
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 13:42:14 IST 2016,   exactly generalized policies like this are open to widespread abuse by gov laws must be exact
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 12:38:53 IST 2016,   an example of jail based on assumptions and precautions rather than justice sure a brave new world
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 12:37:02 IST 2016,   same reasoning could be used on muslims as much as anyone else invites gov abuse
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:37:42 IST 2016,   to say this is worth arresting over is equal to an idea of thought crime aka 1984
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:37:07 IST 2016,   no because the man hasnt done anything further neither of us can know where it leads
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:33:53 IST 2016,   except he never incited a riot now did he he didnt threaten anyone didnt even give a first name
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 11:33:19 IST 2016,  more like i disagree with you call it whatever you want

cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:52:02 IST 2016,cruz wants to patrol muslim neighborhoods basically telling terrorists they just have to move out of a muslim neighborhood lol
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:49:36 IST 2016,  abrams hence the lack of data showing intimate isis involvement
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:49:20 IST 2016,  abrams it seems to me that isis cared logistically about the brussels attacks not about bernardino
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:45:09 IST 2016,  abrams the pattern im seeing is significant figures in terms of warfare on isis eu france us
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:43:21 IST 2016,  abrams i mean that happened because they lived there not because of specific targeting
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:40:43 IST 2016,  abrams such as
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 02:39:09 IST 2016,  abrams yeah its weird people are saying thatthey hit paris and brussels both high security targets
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:59:19 IST 2016,ryan    youre never going to understand nero or ben by talking to people on twitter
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:50:48 IST 2016,so you support restrictions on free speech and unsavory opinions got it 
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:47:40 IST 2016,  article just legalizes gov harassment of unsavory opinions or rude conversation truly frightening prospect
cremedelameme09,Sat Mar 26 00:46:01 IST 2016,   duty does not translate to gov right to place rude people in cages
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:48:47 IST 2016, ive spoken up for other free speech cases plenty why do you assume no one defending his free speech is muslim i am
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:33:24 IST 2016, so only non-white muslims can respond as well about your opinions do you have something against white muslims joe
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:30:02 IST 2016, the response isnt equal locking people in cages is not what the prophet would do just because someone was rude
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:29:22 IST 2016, so you think people should be arrested for being rude how is that not a police state such practices shame islam
cremedelameme09,Fri Mar 25 23:28:36 IST 2016,   where does a gov then draw a line where your preferences end and a white mans begin
