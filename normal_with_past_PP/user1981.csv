offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:29:36 IST 2016,   exactly team is screwed until theres a new owner and even then no guarantee cld be more of same
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:27:43 IST 2016,canucks have 4 on active roster and 3 more in minors inexcusable from benning not one trade for value 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:25:29 IST 2016,  then the team is doomed can never recover im not exaggerating
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:24:14 IST 2016,  do you think aq is that meddlesome i dont doubt that hes getting in there but that much if so thats baaaaad
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:23:10 IST 2016,  ah i see but hed have to be in on these calls then either that or jb would be reporting back directly to him
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:20:45 IST 2016,  seems extremely petty to me even for aq and gagliardi
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 05:18:08 IST 2016, they did in squamish im not buying this story of aq putting the kibosh on that deal nill called jbs bluff and jb lost
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:55:35 IST 2016, hahah exactly
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:55:16 IST 2016,expect a whole lot more of this and with very very good reason 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:54:55 IST 2016, i agree and it just makes benning look like hes 100 terrible at his job
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:52:31 IST 2016,and apparently that wasnt concrete like a 3rd rd pick hes drowning now  
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:51:22 IST 2016, not at all cuz his statements were contradictory left and right and made him look like a blundering idiot
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:50:11 IST 2016,rt  there were the following moved for pending ufas1- 1st round pick7 - 2nd round pick1 - conditional 1st/2nd 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:49:16 IST 2016,but didnt he say that the offer he got from dal was comparable to the one made to cgy for russell 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:42:15 IST 2016,benning straight-up has no clue whats going on hes digging his hole deeper and deeper its now a bottomless pit 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:35:25 IST 2016,larsen isnt even under contract and currently plays in russia and thats what benning is proud of holy shit 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:30:52 IST 2016,  currently only 5 picks in the 2017 draft
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:11:42 IST 2016,and the stars preferred to get raked on that russell deal where cgy retained 0 i call bullshit jimbo  
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:05:43 IST 2016,you know what helps in rebuilding trading expiring ufas for picks and prospects 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 04:02:59 IST 2016,hes weeks behind the rest of the world /facepalm 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:58:55 IST 2016,he has literally given away draft picks in deals this season hes absurd he just doesnt make any sense 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:53:11 IST 2016,focus vision direction whatarethose 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:50:26 IST 2016, thats what hamhuis said in his press conf today
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:46:27 IST 2016,  ok but what im saying is that he outright said no to ec teams from the outset before there were even any offers
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:43:16 IST 2016, i think were talking about two different points here sok - hard in 140 chars
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:41:19 IST 2016, pit and bos were but he stated today that he never okayed a move to an ec team moot point now anyway
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:38:41 IST 2016, not only that kesler denied all along that he asked for a trade hamhuis has a pc and explains the whole process
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:36:18 IST 2016, no nor pit either because i dont think either is that close to the top but wsh absolutely if that became available
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:27:34 IST 2016, i just dont think for 3-4 mos its that big of a deal for the record he did still open his ntc and canucks fucked up
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:23:04 IST 2016,ok but whats the difference between chi dal or the east seriously - thats an hour difference 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:21:42 IST 2016,last week not weeks and weeks ago when they should have been working on this last week 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 03:11:53 IST 2016, wonderful news congrats all the best to you and the growing family
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:19:07 IST 2016, and benning and co should have put these wheels in motion weeks ago
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:18:19 IST 2016,a sobering reminder that the firebenning vitriol isnt solely about hamhuis far from it 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:15:33 IST 2016,canucks are memento 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:15:01 IST 2016,great timing as theyre starting to build up vrbatas trade value wait what 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:13:11 IST 2016,im barely hanging on right now its like a horrific fiery car crash just cant look away 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 02:11:49 IST 2016,yep - im in firebenning
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:53:03 IST 2016,and after allllll of this all i really want now is from  to win the cup so fuck it - go panthers go
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:48:47 IST 2016,just another example 
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:47:55 IST 2016,later rinse repeat doomed to less than mediocrity destined to finish 20th ad infinitum
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:47:05 IST 2016,theyll overpay for terrible players like sbisa and dorsett let more guys walk away for free on waiver claims and never actually retool
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:45:12 IST 2016,theyre gonna end up with a 10th overall pick or whatever and will insist on getting more meat-and-potatoes and bottom 6 centers
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:42:04 IST 2016,i wish i could say that im surprised by canucks management but its just more of the same frustrating incompetent garbage
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:28:20 IST 2016,rt  pirri is a much better player than granlund and went for sixth we gave away one of our best prospects for granlund god bâ€¦
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:27:16 IST 2016, ppl are sick  tired of complete ineptitude  incompetence with this team we had 2-3 good yrs of gillis and then he cratered too
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:19:16 IST 2016, thanks
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:16:20 IST 2016, trading to a contender will always result in a late 1st and that  dano is a great return imo
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:13:02 IST 2016, matt sekeres and tsn1040 and botchford
offersheet,Tue Mar 01 01:09:32 IST 2016, benning and weisbrod and linden and
