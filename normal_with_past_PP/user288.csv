BarryWaller61,Tue Mar 01 05:29:59 IST 2016, wow a lot of negative energy for a team thats still one of the best in the nhl
BarryWaller61,Mon Feb 29 05:46:10 IST 2016,everett   rosen kind of resembles a young jim everett eh
BarryWaller61,Mon Feb 29 05:43:59 IST 2016,everett   is this the la rams future quarterback 
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 21:42:20 IST 2016, everett cusumano favorite combine name temarrick hemingway te scst
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 11:57:53 IST 2016,  its also the main reason that people want to conceal and carry weapons
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 11:56:11 IST 2016,cusumano  yeah but the big o could do so much more then shoot and no three-pointers
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:56:09 IST 2016,  and marshall faulk never ran the ball eric dickerson they won when they ran the ball
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:54:55 IST 2016,  clearly youre just another ignorant but opinionated fan that im wasting my time even trying to educate
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:54:02 IST 2016,  and whether or not you play outside has nothing to do with building an offense
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:53:02 IST 2016,  again you clearly did not see the mess that jeff fisher took over when he came here to st louis
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:52:02 IST 2016,  almost everyone of your observations is completely wrong clearly to anyone who was actually there
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:51:27 IST 2016,  again trent green was awesome in 2000 when he played even though he wasnt even 100 yet
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:50:58 IST 2016,  no one would agree with you on any of this that is actually seen any of it or can  read statistics
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:50:28 IST 2016,  dick vermeil a great coach though his record doesnt show it and it was al saunders / martz style offense in kc
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:48:50 IST 2016,  as far as fisher calling him a complete failure is of course nonsense based on his entire career again just opinion
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:48:01 IST 2016,  i dont think you actually watched too many games especially back then
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:47:36 IST 2016,  and green brought with him a big salary to kansas city
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:47:19 IST 2016,  trent green sucked so much for the rams in a small sample that the chiefs gave up the 12th overall pick to get him
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:46:39 IST 2016,  if you judge head coaches on winning percentage martz one of the better ones
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:46:01 IST 2016,  statistics dont always lie the statistic show you were wrong show me ones that dont
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:45:24 IST 2016,  so again you did not suck in fact he was great when he played over 14 yards per reception  d was terrible
BarryWaller61,Sun Feb 28 00:44:27 IST 2016,  in 2000 the only time you got to start because of injury in st louis he was better than warner 1018 rating 16 td
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 22:52:44 IST 2016,  are you aware that the chiefs gave the rams the 12th overall pick for trent green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:37:42 IST 2016,  i get it you hate mike martz without knowing anything about his coaching ability history or using any facts
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:36:35 IST 2016,  i clearly remember ike bruce pounding his fist on the turf when green got hurt they knew what they had 
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:35:30 IST 2016,  and you clearly did not watch trent green in the 1999 preseason to see how great he was
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:27:33 IST 2016,  and in some of those interviews i was standing right there asking the questions
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:27:17 IST 2016,  and every number shows youre wrong imagine where all the principles said at the time in interviews
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:26:53 IST 2016,  again i dont think you really watch the team back then all that closely based on everything you say
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:26:30 IST 2016,  with warner back in 2001 they scored 37 less points but the defense went back to where it was in 1999 if not better
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:25:08 IST 2016,  actually scored more points in 2000 1999 with warner the whole year but gave up over 200 more on defense
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:23:51 IST 2016,  it was the defense that went downhill mostly that year that and warner throwing lots of interceptions
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:23:03 IST 2016,  you simply have no facts to support your opinion the rams offense lost nothing when green stepped in in  2000
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:22:12 IST 2016,  from everything you say you clearly werent watching those guys then up close at least 
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:19:11 IST 2016,  when he came to st louis he was excellent whenever he played he just got hurt and once he was healthy  he was good
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:18:09 IST 2016,  hes the one that finally got them to play green in washington that walk year and he was good
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:17:32 IST 2016,  martz was not the offensive coordinator in washington he was the qb coach
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 21:16:26 IST 2016,  trent green never got a chance to play till age 28 with the redskins with a bad team he had a pretty good rating
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:22:50 IST 2016,  mike martz specifically wanted green as his quarterback as a condition to come here
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:22:22 IST 2016,   and both mike martz and dv said many times they would have had the same success with trent green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:21:46 IST 2016,  in 2000 starting five games green had 16 touchdowns  and five interceptions warner had 21 td 18 int that year
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:18:35 IST 2016,  kansas city 13-3 in 2003 with that same offense under trent green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:17:40 IST 2016,  also at an older age after a major knee injury trent green starred for three years in kansas city with less talent
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:14:56 IST 2016,  you are aware that kurt warner was on the team in 1998 and couldnt beat out tony banks right  before martz
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:13:12 IST 2016,  they want to 1999 because they added leaders like faulk timmerman bly  holt  collins  green
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:12:04 IST 2016,  i could write a book about that year and about the whole kurt warner story
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:11:46 IST 2016,  warner was not the team leader in 1999 he was in  2001 and as i said i was in the locker room those years
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:10:41 IST 2016,  trent green was a leader big-time so was jeff robinson grant wistrom isaac bruce conwell mike jones
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:08:03 IST 2016,  and you couldnt be more wrong about not having leaders  pace lyght lyle faulk timmerman farr carter fletcher
BarryWaller61,Sat Feb 27 11:06:16 IST 2016,  this team was 100 behind trent green and were devastated when he got hurt because they saw how good they could be
