Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:04:16 IST 2016,speaking of new xcom2 if any peeps have themselves in game id love to add them to my roster same if others want myself in xcom
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:02:14 IST 2016,i could do some xcom2 but something tells me it may be overdone currently unless peeps want to see the original xcom2
Soulsilvatdope,Thu Feb 18 15:01:16 IST 2016,theoretically it should mean at least a small increase in stream quality
