Zyros,Mon Aug 29 19:38:54 IST 2011,in the mood to play wind waker you know i never appreciated how beautiful this game is the graphics still hold up very well over tp even
Zyros,Mon Aug 29 13:09:18 IST 2011,dang that was some sweet music at the end of tonights true blood pre-epic scene too
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 16:11:57 IST 2011,just watched bill  teds bogus journey also found out that a 3rd movie is in the works that should be interesting after so many years
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 13:23:18 IST 2011,also i39m really loving the option to play stealthily like in metal gear or splinter cell
Zyros,Sat Aug 27 13:21:49 IST 2011,watching gameplay of deus ex human revolution this is a pretty sweet game surprised the first part of it takes place in 2027 detroit
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 14:26:23 IST 2011,just saw bill  teds excellent adventure for the first time pretty fun film most excellent indeed
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 10:11:08 IST 2011, haha yeah i suppose you wont be speaking in english too much anymore but i do wonder if youll lose the uk accent now
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 10:07:40 IST 2011, ahh that sucks that they dub them but at least the voices dont seem to be too off
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:18:56 IST 2011, i doubt youll forget your english haha ill make sure you dont 
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:16:49 IST 2011, if its in german thats not so bad huh unless the english voices are dubbed over in german rather than having german subs
Zyros,Thu Aug 25 05:15:07 IST 2011, yeah you really should you will like it for sure it really is the best movie of the year thus far in my opinion 
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:17:39 IST 2011,and as for fd5 the 3d was actually a nice add and the plot was pretty interesting major twist at the end
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:16:26 IST 2011,for once i didnt glance at my watch and was disappointed when it ended planet of the apes is by far the best movie ive seen all year
Zyros,Wed Aug 24 04:14:34 IST 2011,just got back from rise of the planet of the apes and final destination 5 both were pretty good especially the former
Zyros,Tue Aug 23 19:25:57 IST 2011,not sure why i39m up this early haha but awesome to see that the new bleach is up early as well
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 20:00:55 IST 2011,sucks now that some movies are making you see them in 3d rather than giving you the standard 2d option hope this trend doesnt spread 
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 19:59:39 IST 2011,i wanna see final destination 5 tomorrow in theatres but its only playing in 3d which i really dont care for and rather watch in 2d
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 19:20:17 IST 2011, dang well the upside is that you wont have to deal with last nights cliffhanger and can watch them back to back 
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 15:49:20 IST 2011,im glad [adultswim] is airing it otherwise i wouldnt have found out about it now its back to the endless but good one piece series
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 15:47:50 IST 2011,just finished durarara started out a bit slow but turned out to be a pretty good anime series
Zyros,Mon Aug 22 13:09:09 IST 2011,holy crap that was some cliffhanger at the end of tonight39s true blood major craziness going down
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:46:26 IST 2011,but i guess there is sh downpour to look forward to though only i dont really want to buy a new console just to play it
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:44:58 IST 2011,i get they want to cash in on the mmo wagon and all but imo it feels like a disservice to the fans we didnt ask for this from sh games
Zyros,Sat Aug 20 06:43:16 IST 2011,just saw the trailer for silent hill book of memories for ps vita tried to keep an open mind but sigh this is not silent hill
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 06:59:59 IST 2011, that was pretty lucky ive watched some gameplay videos and it looks unique not to mention the story seems interesting too
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 01:06:04 IST 2011,it certainly is very easy to forget this is on a handheld just hope the controls are not frustrating since the 3ds has no 2nd analog stick
Zyros,Wed Aug 17 01:04:44 IST 2011,the trailer and gameplay for resident evil revelations coming for 3ds next year really looks amazing 
Zyros,Tue Aug 16 08:31:13 IST 2011,oh cool next week summer glau guest stars on alphas 
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 15:37:56 IST 2011,45 floors of the hardest enemies and almost no health pick-ups the reward isnt terribly great but it feels pretty awesome to beat it 
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 15:35:41 IST 2011,holy crap did i really just beat the cave of ordeals in zelda tp on my first try did not expect to get through it but wow am i glad
Zyros,Sun Aug 14 05:17:36 IST 2011,wow there is a killer storm happening outside right now these clouds look amazing
Zyros,Sat Aug 13 06:33:06 IST 2011,that was a really interesting and cool episode of thundercats i think this new iteration has alot of potential
Zyros,Fri Aug 12 06:53:14 IST 2011,youtube is trying to be all facebookey now with the new comments section haha i like it though
Zyros,Thu Aug 11 20:20:40 IST 2011, lol weird
Zyros,Wed Aug 10 13:55:03 IST 2011,really wish this kageroza dude in bleach will just die already this arc is going on a bit too long
Zyros,Thu Aug 04 02:16:22 IST 2011, and i cant even sit my laptop on my lap without putting it on something since it gets way too hot
Zyros,Thu Aug 04 02:15:02 IST 2011, those things are so cheap i swear gone through 1 already myself but it was the metal pins inside that stopped connecting
Zyros,Wed Aug 03 06:28:10 IST 2011, wow didnt know she had a singing career makes sense though i think her personality shines more in this than in tvd
Zyros,Wed Aug 03 06:20:30 IST 2011,weird seeing bonnie from vampire diaries rapping lol
