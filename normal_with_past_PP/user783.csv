newdarkcloud,Mon Feb 29 02:03:27 IST 2016,out of the 6 episodes half of them were bad thats not a good batting average
newdarkcloud,Mon Feb 29 02:02:59 IST 2016,so i just watched the last of the 6 new x-files episodes holy hell that was a bad way to end the revival

newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:35:17 IST 2016,say what you will about all these hd rereleases but its made it so much easier to catch up on old games that i missed growing up
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:27:45 IST 2016, i would never dispute that certainly in many respects it ought to be praised
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:11:49 IST 2016,we would not have a lot of game i hold it high regard with ocarina of time so i must at least respect it for that
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:11:11 IST 2016,that said its still extremely good and it is to be applauded for pioneering a lot of concepts that 3d games ie most games use today
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 06:10:20 IST 2016,while i did overall enjoy ocarina of time i feel that it is quite overrated id hardly call it the best game of all time
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:51:42 IST 2016, eh it wasnt a huge issue ill live
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:50:05 IST 2016, no one knew what they were doing with cameras back then
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:49:47 IST 2016, i can live with the camera its a 5th generation console game that comes with the territory

newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:44:42 IST 2016, if i liked lightning returns which i did what are the odds ill like majoras mask
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:41:35 IST 2016,im still not sure if i want to break for dying light or far cry primal before jumping into wind waker though
newdarkcloud,Sun Feb 28 04:41:02 IST 2016,so thats ocarina of time complete i think ill just move straight into majoras mask next

newdarkcloud,Sat Feb 27 05:28:08 IST 2016,i do actually have one complaint for ocarina of time the bosses have too much health
