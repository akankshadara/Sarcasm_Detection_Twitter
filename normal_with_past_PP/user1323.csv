Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:24:43 IST 2016,i live in an area swirling with trump and cruz supporters  be afraid america because murica is a real thing  and theyre batshit
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:21:40 IST 2016,cruzs message is simply i will obstruct all progress just as the nuts wish  ffs trump is more normal
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:20:24 IST 2016,kasich reminds me of the snl skit that had lovitz as dukakis saying i cant believe im losing to this guy
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 09:19:20 IST 2016,ben carson  holy fuck  this guy sucks
Jesse_James77,Fri Feb 26 04:49:26 IST 2016,rt  tedcruz is blocking federal  for flint but in 15 requested federal  to assist houston floods ht jd1 httpsâ€¦
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 11:10:05 IST 2016, already watched haha  i laughed  kind of annoyed laughter but it was funny   i just like it alright
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 09:02:02 IST 2016,as tech increases and is able to get smaller n smaller i think we will someday have light up sabers in 375 that dont look like poop
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 09:00:37 IST 2016,ive tinkered with light-up figures  its rough but ive got 21b where its workable if i can find a place for batteries
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:55:54 IST 2016,i see actual light up sabers in the 6-ish scale are now quite a real thing courtesy of kotobukiya  hmmmm starwars igotanidea
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:21:55 IST 2016,not even watching pens at this point  rather watch sttng reruns
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 08:05:08 IST 2016,   figured these guys could help  just beware  they hoard porkins or something like that  noclue
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:14:12 IST 2016,just spent like an hour panicking over not having old version of office still handy
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:09:20 IST 2016, i have copy i should watch and see  hmmm
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:08:47 IST 2016, see i think like the resistance theyd be funded by the imp remnant which i figure is still big bank roll
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 07:07:58 IST 2016, the topps stuff  nah but  and  both do that and are both good friends   got icmg made by hasbro 
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:20:31 IST 2016, i believe its the same in the film that poe doesnt fire till his buddys dead  i doubt finn sees who/what
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:19:49 IST 2016, so i figure the blasts are probably similar between the two trilogies  just something i found interesting  oh and
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:19:21 IST 2016, that said we really dont see close-ups of blaster shots or even follow-up much  leia chewie get bandaged but thats it
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 06:18:48 IST 2016, imo the new armor would probably be superior to the old if possible  the fo seems to value its people slightly more
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:47:17 IST 2016,at the same time i also find it interesting someone bleeds that much from blaster fire  kinda gores up star wars a bit
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:46:25 IST 2016,i find it interesting that poe killed someone finn cared about clearly but then they become friends
Jesse_James77,Thu Feb 25 05:27:20 IST 2016,ultra bright rainbow today  made me feel oddly happy easilyentertained

Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 09:04:01 IST 2016,kovacevic are you empire or alliance in star wars  its more fun to be the bad guy imo nerds
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 08:21:26 IST 2016, guy on jedidefender mentioned his were messed up and others who ordered online too  weird
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 08:20:07 IST 2016, mine arent like horrid imo but i do plan to take a micro brush and some goofoff and clean it up slightly
Jesse_James77,Wed Feb 24 06:22:25 IST 2016,ryall definitely goofed up p  im wondering if these were not done by labor but rather by machine  for all to have issues
