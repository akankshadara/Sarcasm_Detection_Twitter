transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 05:29:31 IST 2016,so i believe that if you engage people honestly youll get a good return did that even though people say dont read the comments
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 04:38:25 IST 2016,being as a metaphor for posthuman ascension extended gunplay works surprisingly well a bliss state punctuated by bullets
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 04:34:41 IST 2016,being it arguably part of the point but endless mode removes a lot of the exhaustion play as the cathartic reward for freedom
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:27:23 IST 2016, i go milder on grilled cheese usually sriracha or just some red peppers
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:25:27 IST 2016,we tell you because you should know that were here
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:24:56 IST 2016,furthermore we dont mention it all the time ive mentioned it in one freelance piece and like two blog posts
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:23:44 IST 2016,like okay im not really bothered but if you think gays racial minorities or trans people should shy away from their identities no
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:17:50 IST 2016,darling youre going to be waiting for a while it will happen when we dont have to fight to justify our existence
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:16:38 IST 2016,when can we get articles from trans people that dont point out that fact that they are trans
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 03:16:29 IST 2016,forgive me i posted on reddit
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:44:37 IST 2016, it catches me as very agenda driven although i cannot speak to what that agenda is outside iconoclasm
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:33:48 IST 2016,heres the thing sometimes gods deserve to be killed
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:30:44 IST 2016, in tactics its a system albeit it takes years and years for that to happen durai papers and all that
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:29:41 IST 2016, and youre right context is key am i progressing and conquering mechanically perhaps but what is being supplanted
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:29:00 IST 2016, which is a dictatorial application of player/actor power
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:28:09 IST 2016, cool beans the arguments i read basically implied hey the player is positioned as morally right to upend civilization
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:25:50 IST 2016, thats fair but how complicit is the player or ramza
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:21:27 IST 2016, thats what i mean by the planet does the pushback holy saves the planet from the two greatest threats meteor and humanity
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:20:43 IST 2016,the blame rest far more in the genres form than a particular series you could level these complaints against ultima and do so stronger
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:18:42 IST 2016,iv and v are the major exceptions to this where the criticism might apply possibly xv depending on the path it takes
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:15:29 IST 2016,but as a whole to position ff as a series about fascism sort of characterizes the ways in which fascism functions and manifests
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:13:56 IST 2016,iv does this cecil and rosa end up ruling over baron in tay and cecil is special as a lunarian
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:12:15 IST 2016,a broader grosser power narrative would not just deny old institutional powers but replace them with self serving ones
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:11:13 IST 2016,and sure x and lr play into the gotterdammerung angle theres no denying that but they impose no rules after god is dead
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:08:31 IST 2016,the particular exception is x with yuna and tidus completing what braska jecht and auron could not
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:07:24 IST 2016,the series has been going on for twenty years while at least narratively denying the power fantasy posited by the criticism
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:06:18 IST 2016,so while early titles particularly v might fall into the fascist power narrative this starts to ease off a lot once you hit 1997
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:04:36 IST 2016,everyone should play lightning returns it is absolutely scathing in its religious implications
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:03:35 IST 2016,in fact this thesis is so present in that series that in lightning returns she literally kills god and then settles for a simple life
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:02:39 IST 2016,xiii rests in a similar area you may be fated to do something or divinely charged the solution is to refuse the call
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 02:01:21 IST 2016,xii focuses a lot on the ways in which people use power and posits that the good and dutiful thing is to relinquish and let go
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:59:59 IST 2016,xii is explicitly about relinquishing seemingly divine granted power thats ashes entire story arc and the core of the game
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:59:11 IST 2016,squall gets political power when he is chosen to command the garden but he lacks the broader ambition to use it in any manifest form
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:58:04 IST 2016,that game is explicitly about how fucked up the people in jrpgs would actually be
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:56:39 IST 2016,in viii squall might be fated thanks to time travel shenanigans to be the one who kills the sorceress but
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:55:52 IST 2016,as in yeah the heroes stop the bad guy but meteor still falls and the planet does the pushback potentially by killing humanity
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:54:53 IST 2016,with vii cloud is a pretender who wields very little individual power beyond this the original end implies the planet saves itself
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:53:53 IST 2016,i feel that vii vii xii and even xiii dont play into that lets go over why that might be the case
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:53:02 IST 2016,which for the record applies often to rpgs as a form theyre power politics are often very reductive and narrow minded
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:51:23 IST 2016,while i get the inherent idea that rpgs position players as absolute authorities charged on mandate quests to better the world
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:50:48 IST 2016,i gotta take a nap but ive been thinking re some thoughts i saw about final fantasy as fascist narratives
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:46:23 IST 2016,rt jessica here it is a 3d-printed dress covered in a directional landscape of overlapping petals  httpsâ€¦
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:20:34 IST 2016, i know youre playing but my real answer is that food can be games which is not the same as games being good
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:09:04 IST 2016,rt  audioshield mixed-reality first look 
transgamerthink,Tue Mar 01 01:02:50 IST 2016,rt  just found an exceptionally flattering review/analysis of anatomy 
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 23:13:05 IST 2016,kai  i was going to say something similar to this it feels light lacking a better word befitting the spectacular story
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 22:47:45 IST 2016,i will chalk today up to hormones definitely all over the place hiccup in my extended transformation sequence
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 21:52:44 IST 2016, going to get to stream now will list possible titles and pick a date soon
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 20:34:34 IST 2016,ive definitely felt more and more like this at my day job i daydream and think about a ton of stuff that isnt here
transgamerthink,Mon Feb 29 20:33:49 IST 2016,continuing to feel off today with little explanation maybe i am just eager to work on more fulfilling ventures
