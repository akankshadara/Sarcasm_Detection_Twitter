dfg77,Tue Mar 01 01:41:30 IST 2016, i take your point but denying the legitimacy of people who already exist differs from promoting inclusiveness
dfg77,Tue Mar 01 01:37:10 IST 2016,defending a broken status quo looks more like social engineering to me 
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:15:56 IST 2016,   i think he’s got his figures backwards ie 2/3 neg gearing claimants earn under 80k
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:13:41 IST 2016,  gardner given median income in australia is under 50k i don’t think his 2/3 figure makes sense
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:05:49 IST 2016, probably just incompetent
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 12:03:49 IST 2016, he seems to be doing that quite a bit since his elevation
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 11:58:49 IST 2016, that seems very unlikely
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:53:00 IST 2016,snark  yes because the debt is tied to the asset
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:50:40 IST 2016,snark  yes but usually your house has appreciated in value that covers the loan if prices drop neg equity occurs
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:49:35 IST 2016, snark and owner occupiers were getting 95 loans up until recently
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:47:28 IST 2016,snark yes but not everyone will have equity equal to their debt if there’s a price crash
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:43:22 IST 2016,snark no because no one will pay 900k for your house you owe the bank every cent
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:39:53 IST 2016,snark because you still owe 900k even if your next house is a tent and you have to pay the whole mortgage out when you sell
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:33:35 IST 2016,snark exactly and if you sell you need to pay that to discharge the mortgage
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:32:15 IST 2016,snark if i borrow 900k to buy a 1m house then the price drops to 800k i have negative equity
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:28:18 IST 2016,snark not if you owe more than the house you’re selling is worth that’s negative equity
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:26:45 IST 2016,snark yes but if you owe 20000 more than your house is worth it doesn’t matter how cheap the next one is you’re stuck
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:15:37 IST 2016,snark if you owe more than the house is worth you have to find the extra money to pay out the loan when you sell so no one sells
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 09:05:31 IST 2016,snark negative equity would bring the entire market to a screaming halt no one could sell
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 02:12:13 IST 2016, throw in marriage equality and service cut scares too turnbull has left the field open astonishing
dfg77,Mon Feb 29 01:40:04 IST 2016, i got a bindi in my foot once it can be calamitous

dfg77,Mon Feb 22 16:56:03 IST 2016,  f i fondly remember the massive “daniel andrews” signs that adorned his podiums at every event
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 16:54:29 IST 2016, f the persistent present does not allow that besides how many of them would have paid attention to his performance there
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 16:50:32 IST 2016, f people i’ve dealt with in the disability sector rated him very highly
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 16:27:35 IST 2016,f not insurmountable look at daniel andrews

dfg77,Mon Feb 22 02:17:41 IST 2016,maybe we should outlaw compulsory superannuation for high income earners seeing as how they have the capacity to save independently
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 02:11:58 IST 2016,the main reason that “fixing bracket creep” is an effective message is that people don’t understand progressive tax rates
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 01:57:31 IST 2016,hanna wonder if it’d be much different here
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 01:55:24 IST 2016,  it’ll be especially hard in the post-apocalyptic hellscape they’ll no doubt be working in
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 01:53:53 IST 2016, that’s not a bad fallback position
dfg77,Mon Feb 22 01:50:49 IST 2016,if you take low paid workers out of the super system you almost guarantee they will have no retirement savings and we’re cutting pensions
