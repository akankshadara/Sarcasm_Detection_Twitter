QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 02:20:46 IST 2016,  iono if i was early on him im just v vocal in my support of him
QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 00:55:29 IST 2016,rt  the combine profiles are so useful you can use them to evaluate weaknesses 6 seasons into a career 
QBKlass,Tue Mar 01 00:50:52 IST 2016, the problem w/ no4 is they themselves can heavily influence the scheme/line and what theyre capable of accomplishing

QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:04:15 IST 2016, true vs bayern it looked like he was a player who likes to hold his first touch and bayern pressed too much to allow it
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:02:05 IST 2016, is he overrated as an offensive controller in the midfield
QBKlass,Mon Feb 29 02:01:39 IST 2016, iono i think this is just a misfire he didnt reset well when he had time to
