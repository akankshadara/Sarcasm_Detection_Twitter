mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:27:50 IST 2016, can i ask why  varela was awful against lfc on thursday his awful positioning and poor defending let them score
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:26:47 IST 2016, they dont have a vote mate like i said early its like asking a dad to marry his girl  its out of respect not needed
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:25:53 IST 2016,well lose top 4 tomorrow when we get beat off city  and hopefully well take the headlines on monday with the announcement of jose
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:25:07 IST 2016,rt   they wont win me thats for sure im pro mourinho
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:23:10 IST 2016, apparently pre contract signed mate makes sense that scholes actually said live on tv give giggs the job  last ditch
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:20:24 IST 2016, i think saf and scholes and co are trying to win the mufc fans over to the idea of giggs  jose is number in most fans choices
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:02:05 IST 2016,witness so why are people believing the same exact story today not feb 19th  simply cos torres is putting his name to it
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 05:00:55 IST 2016, russell he did last thursday  final push for giggs  scholes said straight out give giggs the job
mrthebomb,Sun Mar 20 04:59:57 IST 2016,rt witness again worth pointing out el pais said in february that mourinho signed contract
