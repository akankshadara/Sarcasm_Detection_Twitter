Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:29:39 IST 2016,2012 was went 6 to 2 for 2 1sts and a 2nd cle went 4 to 3 for a 4th tb 7 to 5 for 4th dal 14 to 6 for 2nd
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:27:13 IST 2016,buf going 9 to 4 in 2014 took an extra 1st and 4th cle 9 to 8 in 14 took a 5th 2013 mia went 12 to 3 for a 2nd stl 16 to 7 for 2nd  7th
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:22:57 IST 2016,  if you mean rg3 going from 6 to 3 is much more expensive than 11 to 8 but yeah
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:08:25 IST 2016, like jets were rumored to be doing with wilkerson a few weeks ago
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 05:06:14 IST 2016,trading up in the top 10 of the draft typically requires at least a 1st and 2nd easy no thank you there 
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:27:15 IST 2016, quality dl pass rushers rarely hit the open market  and theyre very expensive when they do
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:22:52 IST 2016,rt  biggs also doesnt believe that the bears will get a draft pick for te martellus bennett but they are in fact moving on f‚Ä¶
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 04:18:26 IST 2016,meaning malik jackson will be best dl and maybe best player overall to hit fa so he likely gets way too much  
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:30:23 IST 2016, if i could get newton luck wilson done deal top qb under 30 youre set for a decade
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:26:41 IST 2016, i can think of a number of qbs id do that for but they never get that designation for that very reason
Johnathan_Wood1,Tue Mar 01 02:21:59 IST 2016, nobody is giving up 2 1sts  a big contract to sign jeffery
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 21:01:34 IST 2016,rt  happy leapday chicago üêê 
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 08:07:19 IST 2016,42 gonna set the market for og  perfect storm for that plus he might get paid more like ot because he can do that
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 08:05:49 IST 2016,42 osemele is the best ol hitting fa this year  10m/year minimum  fa contracts are gonna be insane
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 07:29:54 IST 2016,  fuller got better as last year went in solid cb
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 07:29:02 IST 2016,rt 42 i was inspired by wood1 i was on a flight bored 
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:26:26 IST 2016,  fair enough like i said i havent watched film on these guys just have had people i know speak well of them
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:22:32 IST 2016,  not a big fan of those players
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:09:02 IST 2016,  curious for your thoughts on my if i were pace next 4 months phil 
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 04:06:04 IST 2016, spotrac says he has 1 year left on his deal 
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:54:04 IST 2016, 31
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:53:17 IST 2016, 13 felt high but a lot of players didnt play all those years
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:52:49 IST 2016, 17
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:52:32 IST 2016, for most positions short shuttle and 3 cone are far more important show change of direction and explosiveness
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:47:37 IST 2016, 13th
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:46:31 IST 2016,  yro could very well be im personally rooting for lots of qbs and little fast guys in top 10
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:44:06 IST 2016,  doubt hes there at 11 anyway im all for special talent which ramsey is i just dont consider him realistic
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:38:40 IST 2016,  mo for fangio/donatell is put resources into front 7 and s find value cb who fit your mold
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:25:31 IST 2016,  yep likely try to add some cheap fa depth there but would be clear weakness of team imo
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:24:32 IST 2016,  i dont really have time to do much more than i already have with it unfortunately
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:22:58 IST 2016,  you guys can publish it there if you want  id have no issues with that
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:22:24 IST 2016, hes still under contract i thought either that or i missed him on spotrac fa list
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:21:59 IST 2016, id be shocked if they spend high pick or give big fa contract to cb
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:21:17 IST 2016,  id be down with that too if theres one there
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 03:20:53 IST 2016, yeah had a bit of time this morning
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:52:23 IST 2016, the more i hear about the draft the more i think bears should land instant starter in one of the first 2 rounds
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:48:38 IST 2016, most of the re-signings i suggest are just that let them earn a spot in camp if they dont fine by me
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:46:52 IST 2016, hes likely looking at 15m a year  i think hell be outside their price range
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:46:28 IST 2016, cheap quality depth who knows the offense  makes sense to me he was solid pre-injury last year imo
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:41:40 IST 2016,not doing any official bears writing stuff due to time constraints right now but had some time this morning 
Johnathan_Wood1,Mon Feb 29 02:41:19 IST 2016,curious for peoples feedback on this mock offseason plan for the bears 
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 05:28:28 IST 2016, im getting a vibe there might be some sarcasm in this tweet  dunno why call it a hunch
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:55:11 IST 2016,  i think its more from ols than coaching but he certainly got into bad habits through both some have improved
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:54:12 IST 2016,  which is common for qbs who have played behind so many bad ols started to see that a bit out of rodgers last year
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:53:18 IST 2016,  yep fantastic arm but can be a bit scattershot on deep balls b/c of bad habit of poor mechanics
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:50:31 IST 2016,  he can throw a beautiful deep ball but its not consistently where it needs to be
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:50:12 IST 2016, either way rankings stuff is pretty meaningless imo hes good enough to win with put a good team around him and go win
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:49:41 IST 2016, but if he continues smarter decision making from last year you could argue lower-level top 10 qb imo
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:49:04 IST 2016, to issues seemed to be put behind him last year well see if that lasts deep ball accuracy still a concern imo
Johnathan_Wood1,Sun Feb 28 04:48:39 IST 2016, statistically hes never produced at that level largely due to to and deep ball accuracy issues
