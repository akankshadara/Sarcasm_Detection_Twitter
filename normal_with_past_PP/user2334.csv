ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:29:31 IST 2016, i have got into a habit of making lists it helps me to tick off the things i have bought and the things i need to buy
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:26:41 IST 2016, both ronnie and honey are good for each other i like their bond over a short period of time now honey is gonna live with billy
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:25:03 IST 2016, yippee 😜 at least someone noticed the silly error it happens
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 05:24:06 IST 2016, i think you are more focuses on tei than eastenders people do make mistakes and i totally understand
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:45:05 IST 2016, i blame whitney for persuading lee to take that pub job i wanted nancy to have that job thats destiny for you
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:43:34 IST 2016, same here i prefer the second sam she was much better than the original and she could actually act
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:42:36 IST 2016, i dont follow no one but i just search the things i wanna find out more what about you
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:41:26 IST 2016, where does twink come into eastenders it must be your typo error hahaha
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:40:07 IST 2016, i loved the scene where ronnie and honey cleaned the house instead of going out to do shopping i loved their partnership
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:38:40 IST 2016, yes i totally agree what he does for us it would be our best interest and hes always right
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:37:01 IST 2016, yes of course i already started shopping for the things i wanna get for the holiday but my list very long i rather start now
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:35:42 IST 2016, i think nancy is feeling unsecured coz lee is heading somewhere in his life and nancy is stuck with her parents
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:34:22 IST 2016, you must have heard that the original sam mitchell is coming back for peggys funeral how do you feel about it
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:33:09 IST 2016, hahaha i am just a big shopaholic since teen years my parents keep saying to control my spending for a rainy day
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:32:09 IST 2016, yes my health is my first priority and everything else comes later
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:31:00 IST 2016, god knows what nancy is trying to do she needs to think about her own life than interfering others
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:29:52 IST 2016, it would give me the opportunity to buy new outfits for daily wear and for special occasions
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:29:08 IST 2016, inshaallah i would be going only 14 days coz i cant handle hot conditions usually we go for 6 wees not this time
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:27:57 IST 2016, nancy wants whitney to be out of lees life she thinks she is confused over her feelings  for him
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:26:12 IST 2016, shes just lonely coz she cant handle the fact that everyone is happy with their lives shes to get a grip
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:25:00 IST 2016, i truly do deserve a holiday after my illness i need sunshine in my life do you have any plans to go on holiday as a family
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:23:34 IST 2016, i was very touched when whitney told her about past to nancy it was beautifully done with a great lighting tone
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:22:07 IST 2016, that would be an awesome idea i just cant stand her i bet shes gonna cause more trouble for pam and her husband
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:19:56 IST 2016, i wanna go too but i have to wait until july or august time i havent been since 2008 coz then i became really ill
ItsAyesha84,Tue Mar 01 04:13:48 IST 2016, absolutely my bro is off on hols for two weeks with loads of sunshine its me little sis and dad stuck in the uk
