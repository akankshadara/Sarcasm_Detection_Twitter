callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:02:26 IST 2016, what is the problem you are having for a start
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:02:05 IST 2016, ballmer nearly ran microsoft into the ground and gates actually i cant really fault him but
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:01:25 IST 2016, if every build contains approx 300 changes then thats a lot of improvement in 365 days of os development
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 06:00:47 IST 2016, it wont take 50 years they launch preview builds every 1-2 weeks and cb builds every 3-6 months
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:59:36 IST 2016, post a feedback on it and see what happens
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:59:22 IST 2016, my dad hates the photos app and would probably give  3 hearty cheers if photo view rose from the grave
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:58:19 IST 2016, actually i believe engineers check windows feedback for new complaints and ideas frequently right 
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:57:28 IST 2016, look were just going to have to agree to disagree
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:56:16 IST 2016,  are you on the current branch 10586 or dev branch 14271
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:55:48 IST 2016, also windows 7 is in many ways inferior to windows10 i wont deny i know ppl who share your view but it probably wont happen
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:55:15 IST 2016, not long windows 10 is improving every day anyway patience is a virtue
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:54:30 IST 2016,  win   will get you to the feedback app
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:54:00 IST 2016,  you might find that other people agree and upvote your requests in which case they might get added
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:53:32 IST 2016,  i have a suggestion for you try submitting the problems you find in a calm manner using windows feedback
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:53:06 IST 2016,  isnt windows 10 a free upgrade i know plenty of people using and loving windows10 definitely works 4 me
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:52:02 IST 2016,rt   i have asked you before to not spam our feeds  this is my last request  i will ban you from tweeting the acâ€¦
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 05:50:29 IST 2016,  jacek if you keep holding a grudge youll give yourself an ulcer try taking some deep breathes
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 02:20:40 IST 2016,    is it still present in current builds
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:56:54 IST 2016,    does anyone know if this bug has been fixed windowsinsiders
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:56:32 IST 2016,    id try it out again but i really dislike frequent random crashes
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:55:55 IST 2016,    this happened on builf 14257
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:55:30 IST 2016,    uninstalling vmware and rebooting solved the problem
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:55:11 IST 2016,    i kept running into a hypervisorerror
callum90ish,Fri Feb 26 01:54:53 IST 2016,   i installed  workstation and my computer started crashing randomly
