hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:23:00 IST 2016, it could be just because clarke leaves polis
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:22:46 IST 2016, well we know that theres a good chance the sex scene isnt in that episode so it cant be too bad lol for how petty they are-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:20:28 IST 2016,the day yall can make a correct theory on t100 is the day ill actually pay attention to the theories weve never been correct dont panic
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:17:18 IST 2016, positive reviews from pretty much everyone
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:17:09 IST 2016, they could like it for the simple fact that clarke leaves polis theres so many reasons they could like it plus theres been -
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:13:21 IST 2016,but just bc they like the episode doesnt mean its negative toward clexa
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:12:29 IST 2016,idk if anything i think itll be a quick kiss that gets interrupted or a hug
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:11:49 IST 2016, but clearly she will be back before the finale because the scene definitely doesnt happen next ep theres too much going on
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:11:25 IST 2016, idk maybe bc they tend to use kim to write the clexa episodes but i just dont see how that means shes back for 3x11 idk
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:05:48 IST 2016,same even if i know its fake ill cry my eyes out  
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:04:40 IST 2016,okay i know lexa is going to be back for another episode before the finale but why is everyone so sure its 3x11
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:03:15 IST 2016, and i think thats when titus and lexa talk and lexa yells the separating feelings line
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:02:56 IST 2016, this is what i think might happen tbh
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 04:01:24 IST 2016,i feel like bellamy isnt going to snap out of whatever the fuck he thinks hes doing until he gets lincoln killed for it

hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:42:25 IST 2016, almost all the screeners love it even the ones that ship clexa to the death so maybe its just a good ass episode even if they-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:41:55 IST 2016, but they could love it because maybe clexa gets interrupted or bc of the titus going crazy thing who knows but ive heard that-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:40:48 IST 2016, yall right bc he doesnt and he doesnt have to overlook you guys even if it is platonic

hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 03:35:26 IST 2016,i feel like there has to be at least a hug lexa wont let her leave without a hug but i think itll be a kiss

hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 01:56:22 IST 2016, not is a whole other thing but why would he have to feel the need to talk about a couple that viewers created and not him-
hedaholic,Tue Mar 01 01:55:55 IST 2016, i do agree that him getting up was rude but you have to understand that to him bellarke doesnt exist whether it will or-
