lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:45:18 IST 2016,lovelt gets a new personal high score on yuuji no-changelast placethank you for reminding me my pure team is the worst
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:41:29 IST 2016,lovelt begrudgingly goes back to playing on ex because my inability to maintain my combo on technical is beginning to make me feel bad 
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:38:07 IST 2016, pretty sure its not because ive done it too many times and some of them at least are really niche and therefore unlikely
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:34:16 IST 2016,jihye faved my what if i drown myself tweet so fast it was kind of alarming
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:33:26 IST 2016,me 1/12 of the way into my self-appointed task this is hard what if i go take a shower because then theres the possibility i might drown

lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:31:23 IST 2016,i still love the katamiyu tag which is literally just me and my friends one of whom vanished into the ether
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:26:57 IST 2016,and before anyone gives me pointers its not paragraphing or html its the hell of summarizing titling and tagging my shit kill me

lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:26:02 IST 2016,anyway im using my intense and powerful procrastination energy to try and get myself to format a dozen fics for ao3
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:25:43 IST 2016,i hate that if a tag isnt canonical ao3 takes out my capitalization so it stands out from all my other canonical tags
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 04:13:13 IST 2016, kun please do i wanna know who my generals are im very excited to get to be a villain in your friend au 0u0

lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:14:32 IST 2016,ebooks yeah thats really not the ideal how am i supposed to motivate you if not with rewards
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:13:05 IST 2016,ebooks this is eternally disappointing to me
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:06:48 IST 2016,ebooks how do you respond to bribery
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:02:19 IST 2016,ebooks feed it to me directly i want it
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:02:11 IST 2016, i can do 3k in an hour but im pretty sure i still wont manage 1k in 20 minutes somehow it doesnt work that way
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 03:01:43 IST 2016,ebooks bangs fists on desk about friday
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:58:56 IST 2016,ebooks i dont have time to write any of these things but i planned a fic for each day this week because i like taunting myself
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:58:13 IST 2016,ebooks oh i wanted to tell you i wanna write rarepair week things in space and i realize my ideal shiramiyu is almost this
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:56:54 IST 2016,ebooks there would be a lot of screaming this is a terrible idea
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:56:14 IST 2016, gently clutches face i love this catwaves vaguely at my to-do list is it a warmup if its gonna be at least 1k words
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:55:17 IST 2016,ebooks i dont think youve seen me do it ever so i guess its more you want to see me do it a first time while screaming
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:53:34 IST 2016,follows up rinbu revolution with cruel angels thesis this is totally a fine and wise choice in soundtrack which wont make me slowly die
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:52:33 IST 2016, sighs loudly you are a very good cat and i am about to probably make an irresponsible decision
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:51:45 IST 2016, i find this incredibly menacing
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:50:43 IST 2016,ebooks its been a really long timebut also writing characters as short-fuse as this is hard for me maybe its better
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:49:22 IST 2016,ebooks nicelets be honest i am very in favor of this as well but none of my fandoms for a while have catered to that dynamic
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:47:12 IST 2016,ebooks although i guess maybe half your ship doesnt want to be punched who knows mine are not at a punching level
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:46:23 IST 2016,ebooks thats kinder the punching pretty much is the kissingi pick one-directional hate so i get a conflict in priorities
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:44:55 IST 2016,i pick ships that can be lowkey hateships on purpose and then i get sad i do this to myself over and over
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:44:27 IST 2016,i just want to write these two characters kissing but i set up a premise where one of them doesnt even like the other in this scene
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:41:35 IST 2016,ebooks im listening to it this was a fine decision its fine
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:36:12 IST 2016,it is five pm and i guess i ought to do some writing
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:35:33 IST 2016,ebooks it worked out for me but now i have to go actually play it
lirahaiku,Tue Mar 22 02:32:55 IST 2016,ebooks okay but your caption makes me wanna listen to the song and i regret this impulse
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 23:14:49 IST 2016, oh dang weird but eyyyy at least you can plan for en im a hoarder so ill def have 50 gems by then
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 23:01:51 IST 2016, time to buy a jp gift card i guess
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:15:54 IST 2016, even if i saved for a whole year though like how many gems would i have 3 shots at umi 3 shots maki im probably broke
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:13:17 IST 2016, or is it that there will literally never be a next shot because screams
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:12:56 IST 2016, time to do three at a time and then sit on my love gems till the next shot then im probably too serious
lirahaiku,Mon Mar 21 22:10:49 IST 2016,lovelt i think im joking but also like my cool and smile teams cant really get any better than they are i just need more urs
