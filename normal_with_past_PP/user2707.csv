RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 05:25:07 IST 2016,i love the way oel plays-- he has a conservative-looking stride but his movement is always purposeful and his skill can take over a game

RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:59:37 IST 2016,either way i hope to see dustin succeed at whatever level he plays at for the pens good guy dece player and well worth another shot
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:58:17 IST 2016,dustin jeffrey has been having a nice year in the ahl and could be better in the nhl without the boat-anchors he played with in the past
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:54:18 IST 2016,the pens also re-acquired dustin jeffrey which i see as a low-risk move with a minimal chance of nhl playing time barring injuries
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:50:30 IST 2016,theres a strong case to be made for keeping zatkoff given that his trade value has been diminished and it was a buyers market for goalies
RoloTony,Tue Mar 01 04:44:02 IST 2016,i think murray will be the pens backup for the stretch run but its still smart to keep zatkoff within the organization
