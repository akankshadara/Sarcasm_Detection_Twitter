djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 05:29:39 IST 2016, it seems a lot more likely that this is a crowd-sourced training bias unconscious or conscious from netflixs users
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 05:29:10 IST 2016, what i think is interesting is the article ends by strongly suggesting this is a consequence of unconscious bias among the devs
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:51:47 IST 2016,  you might be able to trick it into happening outside the repl by wrapping each statement in an object
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:13:03 IST 2016,  preliminary guesswork is that its related to the bug where an object and a type have same name
djspiewak,Tue Mar 01 02:12:45 IST 2016,  i wonder if this bug can be lifted in some way to actually achieve linear types…
djspiewak,Mon Feb 29 22:32:07 IST 2016,rt  things were going well until i hit si-2712
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 02:05:19 IST 2016,  i suppose this is true the goal then would be to be optimize for a higher number of vectors whenever possible
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 01:29:44 IST 2016,  i like to think that almost anyone i interact with knows more than i do along at least one vector
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 01:29:12 IST 2016,  this is one of the beautiful things about intelligence there is no one axis along which it can be quantified
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 01:28:00 IST 2016, over the holidays i went from south florida to central wisconsin to denver to san francisco
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 00:58:49 IST 2016,  i can certainly come up with plenty of cases where implicit conversions are awful this is not one of them
djspiewak,Sat Feb 27 00:58:32 IST 2016,  this isnt a problem with implicits its a problem with integer overflow and dumb numeric types
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:56:29 IST 2016,  its creative if nothing else id give them an interview just on that basis alone
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:52:21 IST 2016, i dont think classtag is serializable
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 03:41:45 IST 2016,  id be very surprised if any public transit solution approaches transit for its use case
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:55:29 IST 2016,  exactly it also demonstrates respect for someone’s domain of interest when you take the time to learn the syntax/semantics
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:44:50 IST 2016,and yet despite zfsko being a perfectly reasonable piece of software it probably is in violation of the kernels license which is stupid
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:44:09 IST 2016,the kerfuffle over zfsko is exactly why i dislike gpl this is clearly not what the derivative works clause was intended to achieve
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:36:57 IST 2016, you may not be a peer in their subject matter but if they treat you as one youll learn unbelievable amounts
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:36:39 IST 2016, mostly all you need to do is be able to present yourself at a level where the expert feels they can talk to you as a peer
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:36:04 IST 2016, i try to familiarize myself with every significant area of the field to the level where i can at least hold a conversation
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 01:17:14 IST 2016, indeed teaching is a fantastic way to ensure that you really know something not to mention seeing it from different angles
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:54:18 IST 2016,the dual of the previous is that almost everyone has an exceptional area of expertise when you meet someone find that area and learn
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:53:45 IST 2016,surround yourself with people who know more than you do you learn nothing from being the smartest in the room other than how to have an ego
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:47:48 IST 2016,  lol thats basically how the world works right
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:39:33 IST 2016, at this point im using an unholy mixture of google maps apple maps and transit
djspiewak,Fri Feb 26 00:39:16 IST 2016, ive been gradually migrating to apple maps the data and search are worse but the app itself is far more usable
djspiewak,Thu Feb 25 23:58:49 IST 2016, wow thats not disorienting or anything… -
djspiewak,Thu Feb 25 03:55:34 IST 2016,rt  taking one big mistake and turning it into a lot of little mistakes is apparently called microservices
djspiewak,Thu Feb 25 03:27:47 IST 2016,rt  if youre interviewing dev candidates and you have to prepare and research a bunch of cs stuff you forgot theyre probably…
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 23:25:02 IST 2016,scaladays is a great conference and im looking forward to attending but their speaker policies have been backwards since year 1 -
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 23:24:24 IST 2016,in news that may or may not be related my talk on type level programming techniques has been accepted
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 23:23:46 IST 2016,im very disappointed that scaladays still doesnt cover speaker travel expenses effectively speakers pay them for the privilege
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:58:11 IST 2016, exactly but they still have windows and a lot of captive eyeballs they want to pivot that audience into more growth fields
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:56:16 IST 2016, where by serious trouble i mean less relevant than theyve been they arent dying they just wont grow
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:55:53 IST 2016, without being able to establish windows phone ms is in very serious trouble in the consumer space over the next 10 years
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:55:25 IST 2016, right and eventually thats enough to influence consumer decisions but theyre already bailing out that boat
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:54:52 IST 2016, parallel efforts stemming from the same need i suspect
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:54:16 IST 2016, they know that fiddling around with ads for a few weeks isnt going to make anyone switch to mac/linux
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 05:53:50 IST 2016, almost certainly a trial balloon microsoft needs to cultivate alt revenue streams from their existing dominance
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:14:35 IST 2016, ah thats fair also i dont think dtrace works on the linux kernel
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:13:25 IST 2016, fuse seems like overkill also i had no idea that fuse still worked reliably on mac
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:12:40 IST 2016, the next step would be to take anything not in that dtrace output and chmod -x after that removal
djspiewak,Wed Feb 24 02:12:15 IST 2016, one random idea would be to run a background dtrace for a few weeks watching /usr/bin to see what actually gets hit
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 23:57:29 IST 2016,rt  every improvement in productivity will eventually get canceled by people who use it to write more complicated things …
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 00:29:17 IST 2016,  ah - a dicewords password takes me about 200-300ms to enter so i dont see it as a factor ymmv
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 00:27:50 IST 2016,  dgreen if someone can unlock the disk encryption my user account protections are irrelevant
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 00:27:27 IST 2016,  dgreen why would you a sufficiently strong password for both should suffice
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 00:24:40 IST 2016, dgreen it seems the only real threat there though is physical access overwrite bios and trick user into booting
djspiewak,Tue Feb 23 00:24:16 IST 2016, dgreen ah i wasnt aware that the bios was vulnerable in that way interesting
