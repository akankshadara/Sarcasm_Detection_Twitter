Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 07:02:55 IST 2016, you should prob fully read before commenting you jack wagon
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 07:02:07 IST 2016, you commented on a thread about me being sensitive  if you read why i am sensitive i was talking about the 9/11 attacks
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:55:29 IST 2016, your comment is in regards to 9/11 conspiracy  what the hell do you think we are talking about
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:52:46 IST 2016, ppl place the blame but not willing to stand by it and fight for what they believe in to make a difference
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:51:41 IST 2016, are you as big as your accusations  prob not and that is what is wrong w/this country
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:48:09 IST 2016, are your actions as big as your accusations
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:47:42 IST 2016, because if you believe that the gov is responsible you need to stand up for what you believe
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:46:38 IST 2016, ok great so you believe that the government is responsible for 9/11  what are you actively doing about it
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:23:30 IST 2016,    if you ask something like hows your mom  i say well my mom is deadthats a bear trap
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:20:47 IST 2016,    a situation when one wanders into a convo that is inescapable
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:16:25 IST 2016,    being sensitive to others seems to be an issue  no one treats others with respect
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 06:14:57 IST 2016,    no this countries problem is there isa growing population that thinks they are entitled

Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 05:28:41 IST 2016,   i can only hope that people that want to have some sort of theory can respect others feelings
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 05:26:52 IST 2016,   then finebut until then what i saw and truly believe is what im going with  unbelievable loss of life
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 05:24:45 IST 2016,   sorry man that is something im not willing to play with  if it comes out that there is a cover up
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 04:53:31 IST 2016,   admitted to the planning and follow through and is now dead  the end
Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 04:52:49 IST 2016,   whatever conspiracy theory you have is irrelevant  the monster that was responsible for those attacks

Flashrg,Thu Jan 28 04:32:04 IST 2016,   i hope the country is not stupid enough to have spent some of the 19 trillion on something like that
