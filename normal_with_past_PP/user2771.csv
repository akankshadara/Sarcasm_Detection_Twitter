plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:22:46 IST 2016,maybe badges could be given to teachers as a type of reward  badges do not have to be for skills only  badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:20:53 IST 2016,teachers receive badges for developing own badges in their content yes there could be many badges for teachersbadgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:16:33 IST 2016,earning a badge for certain criteria/skills is more meaningful than receiving a grade badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:14:47 IST 2016,skills depend on the class  i have seen several badges in all contentsbadgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:13:46 IST 2016,developing badges is similar to making an assessment for a project students can share the badge where the assessment cannot badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:11:02 IST 2016,once a teacher develops own badge there is more of a buy-in  until you make one for students to earn one may not like them badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:09:04 IST 2016,criteria is known from the beginning so the students know what is expected to earn the badge  great way for an assessment badgechatk12
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:07:03 IST 2016, we started badges in 5th grade but teachers are developing badges in their classes students can share them instead of assessment
plumersplace,Tue Mar 01 05:05:36 IST 2016,badges give the students a sense of responsibility/accountability  criteria must be met no shortcutsmust be earned badgechatk12

plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:28:10 IST 2016,doslc  thank you so much to my friends for joining me tonight    thank you thank you
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:26:19 IST 2016,  i agree  even if  1st or 2nd graders can brag about an accomplishment it is a beginning
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:24:51 IST 2016,rt   i agree i think expectations for leading need to be different from grade to grade doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:24:06 IST 2016, i think it is a good idea for children to share their work with parents even if it is only one assignment
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:22:48 IST 2016, doslc do slc need to begin in elementary school  if so when doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:19:00 IST 2016,doslc do slcs need to begin in elementary school  if so what grade
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:17:27 IST 2016, fifth graders thought they had to use the script word for word whereas for 8th graders it was more natural
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:16:16 IST 2016, i think age has a lot to do with how the conferences were led
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:15:37 IST 2016, i believe it was a great learning experience for students teachers and parents  slcs were much more positive
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:14:19 IST 2016,rt   practice is necessary - for ts and ss ss were much more comfortable when they knew what to expect share and saâ€¦
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:14:08 IST 2016, i agree that the practicing made the students more comfortable
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:13:20 IST 2016, i agree the students used the script as a guideline when they practiced but all was natural during their slc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:12:05 IST 2016, looks like some good looking students  
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:11:37 IST 2016, a4 students do need to be prepared and go over material before sharing just as teachers need to prepare for their classes
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:10:05 IST 2016,doslc  do slcs require practicebefore the day of the conference
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:07:50 IST 2016,    
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:07:32 IST 2016, thank you so much for coming    you are a true friend
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:06:21 IST 2016,  another question will be coming soon  
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:05:34 IST 2016,  i am sorry for the parents which could not come  they missed out on an opportunity
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:48 IST 2016,rt    yes agreed doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:28 IST 2016,  this is fun
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:11 IST 2016,rt   i saw so many ss amazed at how much they have learned and accomplished it was rewarding doslc
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:04:00 IST 2016,  yes they want what is best for their child but maybe the discussion should be with the students teacher in subj
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:02:44 IST 2016, i wish my children had had this opportunity
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:01:46 IST 2016,   i agree but i think the younger grades were not as concerned grades brought up because of going to 9th grade
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:00:32 IST 2016,rt    these went so well 
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 05:00:19 IST 2016, a3 definitely the slcs were about sharing the first time many parents were even aware of what their child was doing
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:58:25 IST 2016, as a whole i think the slcs were refreshing for all students teachers parents  grade issues can be later by class teacher
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:56:25 IST 2016, i do think some of the portfolios needed to have more of an explanation
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:55:06 IST 2016, a2 several parents were totally surprised at how well their child did in leading the conference tears in eyes
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:55:05 IST 2016,doslc do slcs focus more on students grades or sharing portfolios
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:54:20 IST 2016, a2 several parents said they heard their child talk more the day of conferences than they had for months
plumersplace,Wed Feb 24 04:53:30 IST 2016, definitely today students are involved in numerous activities after being in school all day  activities not much home time
