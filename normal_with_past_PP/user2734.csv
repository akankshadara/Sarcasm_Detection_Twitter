LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:10:58 IST 2016, yeah it isnt taught everywhere but it is displayed but my point is that in school more so than anywhere else it should be
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:07:53 IST 2016, i dont really understand what your point is anymore lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:07:09 IST 2016,leap day make people crazy i think it does
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:04:05 IST 2016, school is neutral ground then you take it how you are taught to take it some people are taught not to believe it at all
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:00:36 IST 2016, im not in denial i never experienced that lol ive been said this
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 01:00:09 IST 2016, also you were saying school teaches division like with x and king and i disagreed with that as well
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:59:43 IST 2016, i was saying thats not true and if it is its probably cause of their parents not school
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:59:21 IST 2016, lmao no you werent you said after learning about racism white and spanish kids treat black kids differently
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:56:58 IST 2016, lol thats what i was saying from jump racism isnt schools fault you were saying it was and they shouldnt teach it lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:55:50 IST 2016, but if youre right and school teaches a neutral view of slavery then its the familys job to make it positive or negative
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:54:48 IST 2016, youre still making the assumption that you know exactly how racism/slavery is being taught in schools across america lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:53:23 IST 2016, its an assumption because you dont know for sure how  slavery is being taught in schools across america
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:51:27 IST 2016, how do you know that for sure youre making a really big assumption lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:50:15 IST 2016, we cant speak soundly on the mass collective thats my point were two people we can only speak surely on what we know
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:49:25 IST 2016, slavery is negative we learned that is was wrong so like why would i adopted the values of something i was taught is bad
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:48:46 IST 2016, i went to school im not racist or biased are you
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:48:27 IST 2016, i could see why you say that but again if schools were teaching racism i promise you theyd get sued lmao
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:47:09 IST 2016, being different is negative thats your own mindset lol school didnt teach you that someone else did
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:45:57 IST 2016, people teach their children that those differences are negative society teaches that not school bc theyd get sued
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:45:33 IST 2016, children are taught that all races have different history yeah school doesnt teach that those differences are negative
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:44:38 IST 2016, theres a difference between being difference and being divided youre speaking about them like they mean the same thing
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:44:14 IST 2016, you interpret the world as you see yourself i wasnt taught division and so i dont see that division in differences
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:43:35 IST 2016, they had two different methods that actually complemented each other in the long run because i dont look for division lol
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:42:39 IST 2016, but your argument is learning about black history teaches children division if you didnt learn division from that then
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:41:21 IST 2016, this is where personal mentality and interpretation does come into play lol i did not ever see any of these things as division
LuxHippie,Tue Mar 01 00:40:25 IST 2016, again you cant speak for everyone off of your experience i didnt learn division from that i dont know anyone who did
