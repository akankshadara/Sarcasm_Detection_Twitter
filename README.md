# Sarcasm_Detection_Twitter
Sarcasm detection is a particularly difficult task even for humans. This repository contains the implementation of a research paper by Ashwin Rajadesingan in python ML libraries.

# Instructions to contributors
  - Don't forget to add a .gitignore with proper constraints. Minimally :-
    ``` */*.pyc ```
  - Name the files properly for everyone's understanding. e.g. If you are working on extracting the features present in article 5.5, name your file as ```feature_5_5.py```.
  - Only commit a working piece of code to the repo.
  
  - Include a readme.txt in the working folder and specify the python dependencies associated with your piece of code for everyone's reference. Don't simply ``` pip freeze ```.
  
  - :)
